<h2>2015 Cheese Log</h2>  
As you might imagine, many will be repeats - particularly the first ones - as we have been waiting two years to taste our favorites again.  

A note or two about cheeses here. First, the typical cheese assortment for a meal will have a cured cheese (hard, like cantal or comté), a blue (such as fourme d'ambert or roquefort), a chevre (goat cheese) and a creamy cheese (brie or camembert, for example). We try to have that assortment for every dinner, and because there are many cheeses that fall into each category, we can try different cheeses all the time. Except...we have favorites and we keep returning to them.

Second, although in the U.S. we talk about and serve cheese and crackers, the French <em>never</em> serve cheese with crackers. It's cheese and bread, period.

With that said, here's a kind of running log of cheeses we're having. I know I've missed some, because when you're at someone's house for dinner and they serve five or six different cheeses, it's hard to remember them all. I will point out, though, that we haven't yet found a cheese we don't like.  

<h3>5/17 - Not bad for two days here...</h3>  
Petit Gaugry (a Epoisse-like cheese; the fromagerie did not have Epoisse, but this is made by a cheese-maker who also makes an Epoisse, and it's very close. And stinky. And delicious.)  
Roquefort-Papillon (There are different types of roquefort; this is one of them.)  
Comté  
Fourme d'Ambert (a blue cheese from the Auvergne region)  
Saint-Nectaire  
Livarot  

<h3>6/6 We've added...</h3>   
Saint-Marcellin - went right to the top of the favorites list  
Cantal  
Two different roqueforts  
Cavignol - six <em>crottins</em> of differing age. The oldest was stinky! And tasty.  
Brebis  
Brie de Melun  
Brie de Meaux  
Coulommieres - from the brie region, but not quite a brie  

<h3>6/16...</h3>  
Roquefort Verniere  
Salers  
Tomme de Savoie  
(I want to point out that these are the <em>new</em> cheeses we've tried. We keep buying the others because we like them. A lot. Generally, we have five or six cheeses floating around here.)

<h3>6/19</h3>  
Abondance  
Tomme de Bauges  

<h3>7/1</h3>  
Ossau-Iraty (has become my favorite of the cured cheeses)  
Pont Leveque  
Camembert  

Well, I've kind of not kept this up day-by-day. Here are a few more recent cheeses:  

Bleu de Saint-Augur

There have been more; I just can't remember the ones before I started keeping track.

Favorites:  
Hard to say, really, but in no order, we really like:  
Brie, especially Brie de Nangis  
Fourme d'Ambert. You can get this in varying levels of sharpness; we like it as sharp as possible  
Morbier. A soft cheese with a thin layer of ash in the middle.  
Cantal. Our favorite of the cured cheeses.
