We took a day-trip to the city of Noto, about an hour south of Syracusa. Noto is onown as a particularly pretty city, with a bunch of beautiful buildings. The city was built from the ground-up after the 1693 earthquake. In fact, after the quake, when the city's movers and shakers looked around, they decided that the destruction was so complete that they'd just start over five miles away, which they did, thus ending the life of a city that had been founded in 263 BC; 1,800 years of history down the drain.

The new Noto was - and remains - a nice city; starting all over has its advantages. The streets were laid out well, the buildings all designed in the vogue of the day, Sicilian Baroque, and living areas were designed to use the hillside site to provide views.

We enjoyed our visit to Noto - it is, indeed a beautiful place and likely deserves more time. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and like many such places, draws lots of tourists during the day. I think the way to visit Noto is to stay a couple nights so you could see the city before and after the tourists fill it.

<h3>THe Cathedral</h3>
The Cathedral has an interesting history. Built in the late-1600s/early-1700s after the earthquake, it was reconstructed twice in the 18th century after two collapses, likely the result of more earthquakes. Then in the 1950s, it was heavily renovated with new wall and ceiling art, but the biggest change was replacing the roof of the nave with heavy Roman brick and concrete, which caused the whole nave  to collapse in 1996. Maybe the architects should have paid a little more attention to what they learned in archtecture school about loads and stresses, eh?

<h3>The Main Street</h3>
This street bustles during the day! Lots of stores and restaurants and interesting buildings.

I also had a food adventure in Noto. We decided to eat at a pizza restaurant. I ordered a margaite pizza that was described as having
