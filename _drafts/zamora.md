Zamora. Zamora. Zamora...

We first came to Zamora probably in 2010 or 2011. We liked it for many reasons. We recommended it to friends wo came here and returned raving about it. So in 2018, we returned and fell head over heels with this city. This time we came back, stayed four nights, found we like it even better and realized that, after some thirty years of coming to Spain and staying all over the place, Zamora is our favorite place. By a lot.

Oddly, Zamora is not well-known among Spaniards. A good friend who lived in Spain for years told me he'd nevber been to Zamora. We met a very nice young man in a church who said he was born in Zamora, has family there and though he lives and works in Madrid, returns when he can. He said that he has friends in Madrid who have never been to Zamora and know little about it. When we told him that we love the city, he said, in kind of halting English, "I love that you love Zamora."

What is it that we love about this place? Zamora is a good-sized city, population somewhere above 60,000. Its "old town" is separate from the modern development and has two distinct parts, separated by the Plaza Mayor. The western part is really old, with many buildings three- or four-hundred years old. This section has about a dozen Romanesque churches, built in the 11th and 12th century. It has a fortress started in the 7th century. ALmost all the updating and modernizing of this sector has been done with an eye to maintaining the look and feel of the original city.

East of the Plaza Mayor is more modern, "modern" in this case being early 1900s to today. For some unknown (to us) reason, the Modernism movement of buildings that was prevalent in Barcelona, came to Zamora and is expressed in the eastern half of the old town. These are beautiful. kind of art-deco, kind of art-nouveau, kind of unique-to-Zamora style buildings, interspersed with older buildings and churches. 

In this respect, Zamora rewards just walking around. Every block will have some surprising building or plaza or store or restaurant. We walked and walked and walked, and the next time we come to Zamora, we'll do it again.

Zamora also maintains the tradition of the <em>paseo</em>. Every evening, starting at about 5 o'clock, people come out into the streets and walk from the western end of the old town to the eastern end, turn around and do it again and again. You see young and old couples, families of three and four generations, kids, whatever. It is so much fun to join the <em>paseo</em> during the evening. By about ten o'clock, it's wound down, but tomorrow night, everyone's out again.
