<h3>Food</h3>
As is my practice, I took no food pictures. Sorry, I know that's the style now, but not for me. But I want to point out that we had five dinners in Ortigia and every one of them was first course: seafood; second course: seafood. Good thing they didn't have seafood desserts. The seafood here was, as one would expect on an island, fantastic. 

In fact, the seafood at all our stops on Sicily has been fantastic. I'm writing this after our return from Sicily; we had eleven dinners, on ten of which the main plate was seafood, and on most of which the first course and main plate were seafood. The only exception was at a B & B that a no-choice "eat what we serve" dinner and what they served was the best Italian sausage we've ever had.

I might also point out that we drank a lot of wine from the local region of Avola. In fact, on the entire Sicily sojourn we drank a lot of Nero d'Avola. I might also point out that the average price <em>in restaurants</em> of a good bottle of this wine averaged somewhere around $25. Compare that to the average price of a good bottle of red wine in a Seattle restaurant (probably $45 - $50) and you'll wonder why such a difference. I don't know, that's for sure.
