<h3>Eating</h3>
As is my practice, I took no food pictures. Sorry, I know that's the style now, but not for me. I can easily summarize our eating experience in Sicily: seafood, seafood, more seafood, followed by seafood. The seafood at all our stops on Sicily has been fantastic. I'm writing this after our return from Sicily; we had eleven dinners, on ten of which the main plate was seafood, and on most of which the first course and main plate were seafood. The only exception was at a B & B that served a no-choice "eat what we serve" dinner and what they served was the best Italian sausage we've ever had.

We drank a lot of Nero d'Avola wine from the Sicilian region of Avola.  I might also point out that the average price <em>in restaurants</em> of a good bottle of this wine averaged somewhere around $25. Compare that to the average price of a bottle of red wine of similar quality in a Seattle restaurant (probably $50 - $60) and you'll wonder why such a difference. I don't know, that's for sure.
