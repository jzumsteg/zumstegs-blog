summary: A post on some day trips around Avignon and Uzés.  
---  
We upped sticks and moved to the city of Uzés after four nights in Villenueve-les-Avignon. Uzés is a smaller city, with an amazing central marketplace, only about an hour from Avignon. Uzés has a wonderful central market, arcaded on all sides, with stores and restaurants in the arcades, and a huge weekly market.

<h3>Pont du Gard</H3>
On one day trip we went to the famous Pont-du-Gard. Laurie and I had been there probably 25 years ago and since then the Pont hasn't changed - it's lasted 1,800 years, so what could change? - but an excellent museum about the bridge and its construction has been completed. It's quite a sight and well worth the trip. The Pont was built in around 150 AD to carry water to Nimes. The aqueduct is 55 miles long and carried 11 million gallons of water a day(!). The water, though, was full of minerals and over the years became clogged; as the Roman Empire fell apart, no one did the necessary maintenance. By 400 AD it was no longer working. But the bridge remained and still stands impressively above the Gard River. 

Astonishingly, like almost all Roman aqueducts, this was built with no mortar. It stays intact because of its design and the accuracy of the blocks' quarrying.

Here's an impressive engineering feat: the aqueduct that crosses the Pont du Gard is about 31 miles long, over hills and valleys; the starting point is 56 feet above the ending point, which means that on average, the aqueduct drops only 21 inches per mile ((53 cm per ). Even more impressive is that it drops only 15 inches per mile (27 cm/km) over the last 16 miles. This was accomplished with what we would call rudimentary tools - not a laser level or survey tool in sight.

A sidelight: we had lunch at a very nice restaurant with a view of the bridge. It was a lovely day so we sat outside. Everyone enjoyed their lunch except me, who evidently ordered duck jerky. Whoooie, I love duck, but this was bad. I probably should have raised a fuss, but I didn't. Ah, well...

<H2>Windows and Shutters</h2>
In much of France, a town's shutter are all painted the same color, and the colors differ from town to town. We lvoe this aspect of "deep France" that carries on old traditions. Here are some examples (to be continued as we travel to more places):

One other interesting sighting: a very early motorscooter. That's a small engine attached to the front wheel. If it's a true prototype of modern-day motorscooters, it emits an ear-shattering exhaust note.

<h2>The King of Rosé Wines</h2>
I suppose true wine aficionados might argue with the "King of..." description, but I can tell you that not a few French people would say that Tavel rosés are the best in the country, and really, who are we to argue. We love the stuff, so when I realized we were near the source of this nectar - the town of Tavel - away we went.

<h2>Odds and Ends</h2>
We love the roof on this building. We cannot remember what or where the building is.

The walk to a fortress at the top of this town went up and up and up. But the view from the top was beautiful.

A beautiful church. I wish I could remember where it was...
