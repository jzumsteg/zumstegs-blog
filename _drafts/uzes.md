summary: Uzés is an interesting city, not far from Avignon. The city itself has a beautiful central market area, and the day-trips we made were top-notch.

<h3>Pont du Gard</H3>
We went to the famous Pont-du-Gard. Laurie and I had been there probably 25 years ago and since then the Pont hasn't changed, but an excellent museum about the bridge and its construction has been completed. It's quite a sight and well worth the trip. The Pont was built in around 150 AD to carry water to Nimes. The aqueduct is 55 miles long and carried 11 million gallons of water a day(!). The water, though, was full of minerals and over the years became clogged; as the Roman Empire fell apart, no one did the necessary maintenance. By 400 it was no longer working. But the bridge remained and still stands impressively above the Gard River.

Here's what I consider to be an impressive fact: the aqueduct that crosses the Pont du Gard is about 31 miles long, over hills and valleys.  The starting point is 56 feet above the ending point, which means that on average, the aqueduct drops 21 inches per mile. Even more impressive is that it drops only 15 inches per mile over the last 16 miles. This was accomplished with what we would call rudimentary tools - no laser levels or surveying tools in sight.

A sidelight: we had lunch at a very nice restaurant with a view of the bridge. It was a lovely day so we sat outside. Everyone enjoyed their lunch except me, who had what has to rank as the worst main plate I've ever had in France; I love duck so ordered it, and was presented with what was essentially duck jerky - terribly overcooked and dry. I probably should have raised a fuss, but I didn't. Still, the lunch was a success, with that beautiful view of the Pont du Gard.
