summary: Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque Country
---  
When we started planning this year's trip, we originally wanted to return to our favorite Spainish city, Zamora and our favorite <em>parador</em> which is in the old part of Zamora. Alas, I discovered that the <em>parador</em> is closed for renovation for 18 months and snce it is pasrt of the draw for us to Zamora, we decided to look for another place to visit. We had already decided to see San Sebastian, so I looked at other Basque Country cities and came across Vigtoria-Gasteiz. The kore I read about it, the more I thought, "This is a place we could really like." We booked four nights there and sure enough, we loved Vitoria. By tyhe time we left we were planning a return trip.
