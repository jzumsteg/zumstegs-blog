summary: Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque Country
---  
When we started planning this year's trip, we originally wanted to return to our favorite Spanish city, Zamora and our favorite <em>parador</em> which is in the old part of Zamora. Alas, I discovered that the <em>parador</em> is closed for renovation for 18 months and since it is part of the draw for us to Zamora, we decided to look for another place to visit. We had already decided to see San Sebastian, so I looked at other Basque Country cities and came across Vitoria-Gasteiz. The more I read about it, the more I thought, "This is a place we could really like." We booked four nights there and I was right, we loved Vitoria. By the time we left we were planning a return trip.

<h2>A (Very) Little History of Vitoria-Gasteiz</h2>
It's known that in the 11th century there was a village named Gasteiz on the hill here, and that it had a church and was walled, indicating that it had some importance in the area by then. In 1181 the Spanish king Sancho the Wise built up the small town into a defensive outpost and named it Vitoria for reasons unknown, but it quickly became Vitoria-Gasteiz, combining the Spanish and Basque names for the village.

In 1813 the French army of Joseph Napoleon met the British, Portuguese and Spanish army, under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington (later the victor over the Emperor Napoleon at Napoleon's final battle, at Waterloo). Wellington's army prevailed here, too, and started the demise of French control of Spain. Unlike San Sebastian, Wellington left Vitoria-Gasteiz intact, and it has been the capitol of the Basque Country, first an unoffical role, but formalized in the late 1900s and early-21st century, with the Basque Parliamenmt meeting here, and the Basque Prime Minister living here.

Residents of Vitoria-Gasteiz are called <em>vitorianos</em> by English speakers, and <em>gasteiztarrak</em> by Basque speakers. But traditionally they are called <em>babazorros</em>, Basque for "bean sacks." I think that's a little fact everyone should know.

<H2>Vitoria-Gasteiz, the Town</h2>
Several decades ago, VG decided to become a "green city." The city government put in place plans to build parks, reduce automobile traffic and improve the environment of the city. They succeeded: in 2012 the city was named a "Green Capital City" (the first in Spain) and in 2019 the UN designated it a "Golden Green City." There are four huge parks surrounding VG, each focusing on a different type of natural features: wetlands, forests, etc.

For us, we saw this in many of the streets of VG. Many have been pedestrianized.

The Old Town of VG has the same street plan as seen on maps of the city from the 14th century. Most of the buildings are, of course, not that old, though some of them are even older.

VG has a beautiful main plaza, the Plaza of the White Virgin (after a statue in the middle of the plaza.)

(Ask me for details, if you're interested.)  </em></figcaption>

<h2>Vitoria-Gasteiz Street Art</h2>
Hoo, boy: going to see some pictures in this section. Laurie and I like "street art:" art done in outdoor places, usually on buildings. Some years ago VG started a competition for wall murals, to be painted on buildings, mostly in the old part of town. The process is that artists submit designs and residents of neighborhoods choose which one they want in their district. Each year residents can choose a new design or keep an existing one for another year. The result is a bunch &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; about twenty &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; of huge, colorful, creative murals, all of which has some connection with VG. 

The Office of Tourism gave us &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; among a ton of stuff, a map of the murals. Even with it, we had to do some sleuthing; the last one took us a couple days (it was behind a locked gate in a park). We think the only one we didn't see had been removed when the building exterior got renovated.

But here ya go: all the ones we found (or at least all the ones I remembered to take a decent picture of).

<H2>Other Street Art</h2>
The tradition established by the quality of these murals seems to have inspired street-arts workog on a smaller scale. While Vitgoria-Gasteiz is plagued by the ubiquitous presents of tags and other graffitti, many of the buildings had smaller, really creative art. I suspect these are autorized by owners, or at least tolerated. 

Here are a few of our favorites:
