summary: Soria - a very nice city, but the day-trip to Berlanga trned ups something spectacular.
---  
We left the Basque Country &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; reluctantly &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; and headed a bit south. Next stop, after a drive through the wine regions La Rioja and Ribero del Duero, we arrrived in Soria. And immediatelyu ran into a minor problem.

the Spanish givernment runs a chain of excellent hotels called Paradores. Many are in historic buildings converted for use as hotels. Others &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; like Soria &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; are in purpose built buildings. All are very nice, though the interiors and rooms in most are certainly Spanish &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; dark woods and carpets. We like the paradores a lot and stay in them whenever we can.

The Soria parador sits high on a hil overlooking the hilly country-side. Since we'd booked an upgraded "superior" room, we figured we get one with a nice view. Not so much. Our room, which was huge and very nice, looked out on the entrance to the hotel, park of the parking area, and a stand of trees that, while lovely, blocked any sort of view. Not what we expected.

So, down to the reception area where we asked if there were any rooms with views that we could move to. At this point, the fellow who had checked us in started quite a line of hog-wash. We'd have to downgrade to a regular room - fine with us, could we see one? Well, no, and besides, the trees on the view side grow so fast that all the rooms in the parador have their view blocked by trees. After a little of hooie, we gave up. But a look from outside showed that all the rooms on one side of the parador had a beautiful view. We gave up and went back to enjoy our very nice room.

But honestly, this was the only parador experience we've had (and we've stayed in 17 of them, multiple times in several) that made us say, not here again. The fellow who ran the bar/cafe was a grump every time we were there, the restaurant had two people trying to serve at least 15 tables of folks (the food was excellent, though) and generally, it was not an enjoyable stay. Besides, the walk into Soria was about 20 minutes &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; okay going to the city because it was all downhill, but returning, all up-hill, of course. Oh my aching calves!

Soria, though, has great potential for a return visit &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; staying in the city itself next time.

<h2>Berlanga</h2>
This was the star of our stay in Soria. We visited the Officina del Tourismo and, as usual, came away with an armful of brochures and maps, from a super-friendly woman. (When we started traveling with Mary and Gilles, they always started at the tourism office of whatever town we were in. We have followed that advice and are amazed at the amount of information we have always received, from the nicest people you could want to meet.)

One of the brochures had day-trips in the province, and one of them was to a castillo at Berlenga. Now, we are fortress fans, so the next day, we headed to Berlenga, not knowing what we'd see. We drove through the town, realized we'd gone too far, started to turn around when we saw a sign pointing to the Castillo. So we turned off the main road and this is what we saw:

    <figcaption><em>Holy cow! That is a fortress - we were immediately gob-smacked. In a country with many fortresses from centuries of one army protecting against another army, this is the most spectacular</em> castillo we've seen.</em></figcaption>

This <em>castillo</em>  went through many iterations, like most <em>castillos</em>  did. It was built originally in the 10th or 11th century by the Islamic Moors, who had brought much of Spain under their control. The Berlanga <em>castillo</em> was an important one in the northern-most reach of Islamic Spain. 

In the mid-11th century Fernando I of Castile - what passed for a king of Spain - started pushing the Moors southward and was able to defeat them in the Berlanga <em>castillo</em>. The Moors damaged a couple walls as they left. Fernando I rebuilt the Islamic fortress and maintained it as insurance that the Moors would not be able to re-conquer this area.

In the late 1300s, this whole area around Berlanga came under the private ownership of the Tovar family, which then started several centuries of rebuilding and reinforcing the fortress, which brought it to the shape and size it is today. Between then and now, some of the <em>castillo</em> fell into ruins, bt no one was interested &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; or had the funds &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; or the reason &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; to restore it.

Because the turning back of the Moorish tide in the 11th and 12th centuries was instrumental in Europe keeping its cultural heritage, the European Union became interested in restoring the Berlanga <em>castillo</em> and provided funding for the research and work necessary which was completed over the last ten years. So now the <em>castillo</em> has been largely restored, with walkways for visitors and many explanatory panels. The Berlanga <em>castillo</em>, represents a turning point in European and Spanish history and shows us today what fortresses were like and what life in them was.

So Laurie and I parked at the bottom of the hill and walked to the entrance, which ws a small building with a sign "Officina de Tourism" on it and the entrance door to the <em>castillo</em> . Also a printed sign saying that the office was closed and the employee of the Officina de Tourism was at the "Colegiata." There were three men also standing around also trying to figure out what to do. At Laurie's urging I walked over to them to ask, in Spanish, what the situation was. "<em>Disculpame, por favor"</em>: I started; one of them replied, "Yes?" Then he laughed and said that he spoke English. And he did, as well as me, I think. It turned out the three were brothers who had been raised in Berlenga and who had come there as a family reunion and to see the restored castillo.

Laurie and I walked to the Colegiata (the main church of the town) where there was, indeed, an employee in a booth. She locked up her booth and took us back to <em>castillo</em> which she opened for us. She told the five visitors that she had to return to her other office and that we could go anywhere in the <em>castillo</em> and stay as long as we wanted, but we had to make sure that when we left we closed the door and made sure it was locked.
