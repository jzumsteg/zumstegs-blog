After visiting the<em>Villa Romana</em> we made the two-hour drive to Syracusa, where we stayed for five nights. We had planned for just four nights, but then Transavia cancelled the flight on our preferred return day and gave us the choice of returning a day early (not enough time in Syracusa) or a day later (maybe too much time in Syracusa). As it turned out, we were able to enjoy all five days there, but pushing the flight to May 1 caused us some problems getting home (next post).

Syracusa is a good-sized city - about 170,000 residents - but the interesting part is the island of Ortigia, where we stayed. Ortigia is where Syracusa was founded and remains far and away the most interesting part of the city. It's small: about three-quarters of a mile long and half a mile wide. Many of the buildings were constructed after the 1693 earthquake that pretty much leveled every town and city in eastern Sicily. Now a UNESCO-designated site of historic interest (what's the real title for this?), Ortigia is an historic city in a beautiful location. We loved the place.

There is, of course, a downside to being a beautiful, historic city: lots and lots of tourists. During the day Ortigia was pretty crowded, not helped by the weekend we were there being a holiday weekend. But, as with so many places that attract hordes of tourists, the town started to empty out at about six or seven in the evening and by eight, it had returned to what it must have been like hundreds of years before: quiet narrow streets, walks along the water deserted, excellent resaurants with plenty of seating. 

Now I know that among that horde of tourists that I complain about were the four of us - tourists, for sure. But I'm pretty sure we were different from all the others. Really.
