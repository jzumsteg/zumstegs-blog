We went off on a one-day ramble south to the town of Sancerre - home of our favorite white wine. We had a fine lunch, got some wine from the same winery at which we've bought wine since 2013, then visited an interesting abbaye on the way back. A long day, certainly, but highly enjoyable.

<h2>Sancerre - the town and the wine</h2>
THe town of Sancerre - about and hour and a half south of us here in Bois-le-Roi - sits on a hilltop, the perfect image of a charming French village. The town itself exists now for one reason: selling Sancerre wine to people who come for that reason. The result is that Sancerre has beautiful views over the countryside, some excellent restaurants, lots of places to taste and buy wine and not much else.
