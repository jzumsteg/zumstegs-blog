After our adventuresome return from Sicily, Laurie had only one day to get everything washed and re-packed for our departure to Spain - driving this time. We didn't plan it this way; we expected to have two days to do all that, but Transavia cancelled our Sunday flight and put us on a Monday one. By then, we had booked three places in Spain and arranged to spend time with friends in the Pyrenees mountains and we didn't want to change all those arrangements. In a Herculean effort, Laurie got it all done and about 9 Wednesday morning we jumped iontp or leased car and headed south.

Big surprise of the day: there were no surprises. Our car ran fine; our debit cards worked in the machines on the toll roads; the hotel at our stopping point - Saint-Jean-de=la-Luz - was fine; we found free parking and a good restaurant in the city. All was good!

The next day got us to our first stop in Spain, Zamora. I will do a post for Zamora; for now, suffice it to say that we were glad to be back in Spain and especially glad to be in  Zamora.

Hard to believe, but it was over 40 years ago that I first visited Spain, on a business trip for Boeing. I fell in love with the country immediately. I made six Boeing trips to Madrid and the Boeing sales manager there, Pat Finnegan, was always glad to arrange meetings with the airline on Fridays and Mondays so that I "had" to stay over the weekend. For many years, Spain was a hobby for me; I was always reading histories of Spain, or books about Spain or trying to learn Spanish. We've visited Spain on vacation probably eight or nine times, and we are always so happy to return. No exception this trip.

We stayed in three different places: Zamora for four nights, Lerma for two and Sos del Rey Católico two nights. I'll post about each.

Ahora, España...
