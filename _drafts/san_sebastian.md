Like everyplace, San Sebastian has a long and interestoing history, which I'll spare you. For our purposes, the important event occurred in 1813, when British and Portuguese troops besieged the town, then &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; along with the rest of Spain &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; was held by French troops. Once the British and Portuguese had defeated the French, they burned the town to the ground. This meant that much of San Sebasgtian had to be built again, and this time the city could afford bigger and more beautiful houses.

Many of those buildings remain, though many have been replaced over the years. Laurie and I have come to appreciate and search out beautiful buildinsgs; in San Sebastian, that ws not hard. 

We stayed in a very nice hotel in San Sebastian - the Arrizul Congress Hotel. Although the rooms were European small, the hotel had just the nicest people working there and a little perk: in the lobby was always a bottle of nice cava and champagne glasses. We took advantage of the perk a lot.

We were glad to be in such a nice hoitel, because we had to wait out some of downpours and it was nice to do so in a decentg room. Weather was about the same as Seattle's January weather - cold and wet. Folks said that even for May in this wet part of Spain, the rain while we were there was excessive. But, being long-time Seattle residents, we just put on a sweater, a sweatshirt, a warm coat and a raincoat, picked up our umbrellas and away we went.

We enjoyed poking about in San Sebastian and though we had to wait out more than one downpour, we liked the city. The pintxos scene was great fun. Honestly, I doubt we'll be back to San Sebastian &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;a little too touristy and though we loved the pintxos bars, not enough to bring us back.
