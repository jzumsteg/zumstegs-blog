summary: Off to Spain! First stop, San Sebastian in the Basque Country.
---  
Laurie and I have visited Spain on vacations maybe ten times, and on those trips have seen most parts of the country, except two: the area in the southeast, anchored by Valencia, and the Basque Country. I think we'll get to Valencia someday; on this trip we took care of the Basque Country, with a week-long visit to two of the most important cities: San Sebastian and Vitoria-Gasteiz. Spoiler alert: we like San Sebastian and loved Vitoria-Gasteiz. <em>Ahora, ¡vamos a España y el pais Basque!</em>

<h2>Pintxos</h2>
Anyone who has spent any time at all in the Basque Country knows about <em>pintxos</em>. (Pronounced "pin-chose>" - "tx in the language of the Basques is pronounced)
