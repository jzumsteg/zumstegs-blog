summary: No, it's not pronounced like "shampoo," but it's close. We went to a choir concert in a church in Champeaux, and then returned to have a better look at the church. 
---  
The church in the small town of Champeaux, population about 815. Earlier in the trip we saw a Basque Choir present a concert here . They were great, but we didn't get a chance to look at this somewhat unusual church. A few days ago we were with Mary & Gilles on a day-trip ramble and, being not far from Champeaux, I asked if we could go there to take a look at the church. In fact, we were about five miles awy, so to Champeaux we went.

The church is the Collégiale Saint-Martin de Champeaux. Cathedrals are the home of an bishop; parish churches&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the most common in the Catholic structure&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;are the neighborhood churches. In the past a parish church would have a priest; today, only the biggest do, and the priest often serves multiple parish churches in the area. Collégiale churches sit between the cathedral and the parish church. 

In France, collégial churches were, until the French Revolution in 1789, staffed by canons. The canons handled all the duties of the church - liturgical and pastoral. They were almost always ordained priests and lived in a communal setting. The Collégiale Saint-Martin de Champeaux was such a church - too big to be a parish church and too small (and not having a bishop) to be a cathedral. 

This is not your everyday, run-of-the-mill church, though. The church bills itself a "The little sister of Notre-Dame-de-Paris," because it is big (though not as big as Notre-Dame by a long-shot) and Gothic. When we walked into this church to see the Basque choir, I said, "This is an old church." Indeed: construction started in 1160 and finished in 1270; Notre-Dame de Paris was mostly constructed from 1134 to 1260, so these two churches were built over the same period. Both are Gothic, but the resemblance pretty much stops there. 

As a cathedral, Notre Dame has always had the funding to maintain it; Saint-Marte de Champeaux has suffered from centuries of not enough money to keep it up. To a large extent, this is a result of its location - in a small town fifty miles from Paris. 

But still, it's worth a visit to see a large Gothic church in wat is pretty much its original condition.
