summary: Some people just want to see food pictures. I'm not a great enthusiast of taking pictures at every meal, but I do have some pictures that foodies might appreciate - and that will get Laurie and I through until we can return to this nation of foodies.

<h2>Desserts</h2>
I'm telling you, desserts in France are an art-form. They <em>always</em> look beautiful, and they're always delicious. Here's a few we had. I am, unfortunately, not going to be able to tell what each one is; they all run together in a blur. Urp.

    <figcaption class='wide'>This is in a boulangerie window. There used to be boulangeries (bakeries: bread, etc.) and patisseries (pastries: desserts, tarts, etc.). Over the years those two have become one so you'll see something like this at every boulangerie.</figcaption>

    <figcaption class='wide'>We had this dessert in a small restaurant in a small town in the country. It's not unusual to find such a place; good restaurants are not limited to the cities.This was part of a three-course meal that was really tasty and copious and...wait for it...$24. </figcaption>

<h2>Buying Food</h2>
Buying food is a little different here. Although there is one huge store twenty minutes away (huge as in: at least three times the size of our local Costco; an amazing food section, with a bakery, a meat market, cheese shop, wine section, home goods, appliances, computers, clothing for men, women and children, from underwear to suits and dress gowns), we shop in smaller local markets. The town right next to Bois-le-Roi has a grocery store that is our main "go-to" for food and staples, and a fifteen minute ride away is a fabulous store for fruit and produce (and cheese and paté). Bois-le-Rois also has a small market on Thursdays and a bigger one Sunday mornings which we use.

    <figcaption class='wide'>In a food market. Almost every town has a food market with vendors that go from town to town. Asparagus was in season when we first arrived and this vendor - in Villenueve-les-Avignon - had several types. We have never had asparagus as good as we had here this year. </figcaption>

    <figcaption class='wide'>In our local grocery store: A "burger kit." Got it all: two patties, two buns, two ham slices, onion, lettuce, cheese, tomato, mayo and mustard. Cost is a little over $4 for each burger. Not bad in the land of $20 hamburgers. We didnt buy one, which I kind of regret.</figcaption>

<h2><em>Plats</em></h2>
The main course of a meal is the <em>plat.</em> It is not, as in the U.S., called an <em>entrée</em>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;don't get me started on why United States restaurants use a word that means "entrance," that is, the first course, for the main course.

Almost all restaurants will have a "menu:" for a set price you can choose an <em>entrée</em> (first course) and a <em>plat</em> (main course) or a <em>plat</em> and a dessert. For a higher price you can choose an <em>entrée</em>, a <em>plat</em> and a dessert. The <em>menus</em> are always a good deal. You'll get two or three or four options for each course. You can, of course, choose other menu items from the <em>a la carte</em> but hoo-hah, that can get expensive.

    <figcaption class='wide'>Salmon. Being from Seattle, we know salmon. Almost all salmon in France is Atlantic farm-raised salmon. (If you can find wild salmon, like we get here all the time, it will be prohibitively expensive.) But if the salmon has less taste than we're used to, the chef will make up for that with amazing sauces.</figcaption>

    <figcaption class='center'>Lunch at Boullion Chartier. There's a story here...</figcaption>
</figure>
The story is that we'd read about Boullion Chartier and wanted to try it. Boullion Chartier is three restaurants, all in wonderfully-decorated facilities, that serve traditional French food at amazingly low prices. One reason they can do that is quantity: the restaurant we visited seated probably 125 people, and lunch was not exactly leisurely. If you're two people, you likely will be seated at a table for four or six, with the other seats taken by someone you don't know. It sounds bad, but in fact, it's no problem. You say, <em>Bonjour</em> to the other folks as you sit down, and that's the only connection you'll have with them. <em>Pas de problem.</em>

Here Laurie is looking a little skeptically at steak-frites, said to be the highest-selling meal served in France. You see steak-frites in most restaurants for $25 up. Here it was about $13. Although the restaurants get good reviews, Laurie (and I) were a little skeptical, but in fact, the steak-frites was just fine. Not Michelin-star quality, and probably not as good as $40 steak-frites in a fancy restaurant, but just fine. 

The Boullion Chartier restaurants must be good, because all three will have lines out the door for lunch and dinner. We arrived at about 1:30 and waited maybe ten minutes. 

One thing to note in the pictures: every plate served is beautiful (except Boullin Chartier; what do you expect for $13?).

<h2>Other Food-Related Thoughts</h2>
Laurie asked me to add some words about other aspects of eating in France, so here's a few.

Sunday lunch is traditionally a big family meal in France. Early in the afternoon families gather for <em>aperó</em> followed by a full (and I do mean full) meal: <em>entré, plat, salad, cheese, </em> and <em>dessert</em> for everybody. This is such a big deal that in France, you can mow your lawn or do other noise-making things Sunday morning, but not Sunday afternoon. We found that if we walked through our neighborhood on a fine Sunday afternoon, we could hear big dinners going on in the house or in the backyard. Many big dinners.

Despite the stereotype of French men and women starting every day with a <em>croissant</em> or other bakery goodie (Laurie and I favor <em>pain-aux-raisins</em>), French folks rarely do that. Tourists, including us, may have <em>croissants</em> every day, but generally not the French. But on Sundays <em>boulangeries</em> sell <em>croissants, pain-aux-raisins, pain-chocolate</em>, etc. like there's no tomorrow).

Another Sunday lunch change is that it's okay to have butter on your bread. And wine at lunch. French folks do not butter their bread, but it's acceptable at Sunday lunch. Same with wine at lunch - Laurie and I have it, but the French will likely have water, unless it's a fancier, more formal lunch. It's not that wine at a lunch is a cultural forbidden, it's that French do not meet their "wine all the time" stereotype.
