<h2>We're Back.....</h2>
Friday July 14th we finished packing up, cleaned the great house in which we lived and which we thoroughly enjoyed for two months and headed for the airport. Traffic was no problem, I decided the GPS was taking us the wrong way and was proven to not know what I was talking about, turning in the car was quick and easy, and the shuttle to the terminal no problem. Getting our bags checked-in was a mess - in twenty minutes a total of two people were served in the long line we were in - until a supervisor showed up and got things moving; we boarded on time and because of a fluke in how our reservations were made we were in Delta's Select class which is kind of between Business Class and their upgraded economy class and which was very nice. Then a four-hour layover in Minjeapolis and a quick flight to St. Louis, where Craig picked us up at about midnight. 

At that point, we had been up for almost exactly 24 hours and we were whupped. No welcoming tiki drinks for us that night - it was to bed as fast as we could go.

We had a fine time in St. Louis except for one tiny problem: COVID. A day or so before we left France Laurie had a bit of a sore throat, but it had pretty much gone away by the time we left. So when I had a bit of a sore throat Sunday night we thought, "Eh, I must have caught the bug Laurie had." Right. Monday morning I was coughing and hacking and had terrible congestion and a headache. But, being expert at denial, I said no when Craig asked me if I wanted to be tested for COVID.

Unfortunately, Friday morning Craig came downstairs and said, "We're testing you. Annie just tested positive (she tests every morning before she goes into her lab), I tested positive and Clara tested positive." He was right: I tested positive, too. By then my symptoms had improved greatly and by CDC guidlines, I was no longer contagious, so we came home that evening.

It wasn't done with us, thugh. Sunday Laurie woke up feeling punk, and tested posiitve. She went to an urgent-care type place because Annie had recommended she get on Paxlovid immediately if she tested posiitve. So Sunday night Laurie started Paxlovid. It's a miracle drug: by Monday morning she felt fine, except for the horrible taste Paxlovoid leaves in your mouth.

I'm writing this Friday, two weeks after we left France and a week after we left St. Louis. Laurie's fine (though we haven't re-tested her), I'm almost back to normal (though I tested positive two days ago). It's quite possible we will test positive for a couple weeks(!) and also possible that we'll have re-bound infections.

Since the start of the pandemic I've said, "Everyone is going to get COVID at some point." Now we've had our turn in the barrel and I can tell you it was no fun. Lesson learned: at the first symptom, get tested and if you're positive, get on Paxlovid. It was no dang fun being as sick as I was that week in St. Louis.

<h2>Trip Wrap-up</h2>
We had a great trip! Until 2021 our long-stays in France were from mid- or late-May until mid-August, which meant that much of the time we were there our friends were off on their vacations. In 2021 we went later and were able to see our friends much more; this time we went earlier (mid-April) and also were able to see all our friends. We have made so many really good friends in France that we call them our "French Family." Want to see pictures of them? [Our french Family]({%  post_url 2023-07-11-people %})

So thanks to Jamie and Hervé, Mary and Gilles, Yves and Valerie, Penny and Pierre, Riitta and Benoît, Lesly and Pierre, David and Ann-Marie, and David and Sally (who let us stay in their oh-so-comfortable house for two months).  You all are just the greatest; it's an honor and a joy to have you as our "French family." Thank you for all you did for us when we were there. We can't wait to see you all again soon.
