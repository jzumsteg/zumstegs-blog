summary: Our "French family" and other folks we've been able to spend some time with here.
---  
I sometimes refer to our "French family" here - people that we've become great friends with over the years.

<h3>Pictures from Brittany</h3>
Jamie and Hervé invited us to spend five days with them at their Brittany house, in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon (you can find it with a Google Earth search), along with Valerie and Yves. We had a most-excellent time! Some pictures from those days...

    <figcaption><em>Riitta and Benoît. In 2015 we house-sat for them for 2 months in their beautiful house and became good friends from the minute we met them. You can see from the picture they are fitness nuts. Indeed: fitness as in entering a competition to run around Mt. Blanc in Switzerland: 63 miles of trail running. We always enjoy hearing of their fitness adventures, but joining them? Not gonna happen!</em></figcaption>

<h3>Dinner in Paris with our Pau friend, Pierre</h3>
Pierre works in Paris and commutes weekly from Pau. We had a great time with Pierre and Penny when we visited them in Pau earlier in this trip ( [see Pau Post]({% post_url 2023-05-26-pau %})). Last week we were in Paris and Pierre was able to join us at our favorite bistro, <em>Le Triomphe</em>, which is just a few minutes walk from Mary and Gilles' flat where we stay in Paris. We had the best time at dinner - lots of talk and laughs. We were sorry when Pierre had to leave because public transport was starting to close down - a result of the protests occurring nightly in the suburbs of Paris.

I can't tell you how mad I am at myself that I didn't take pictures of Pierre <em>and</em> Penny when we were in Pau, so I would have a picture of them both to post. Grrrrrrr. 

<h3>Phew! Almost didn't get to see Lesly and Pierre</h3>
They were busy, we were busy; we had a heck of a time getting together with our friends Lesly and Pierre. At the last possible chance, they made time for dessert (and champagne, of course) on the day before they left for their summer home.

    <figcaption><em>Lesly and Pierre. We are so thankful that they squeezed us into a very busy schedule so we could see them. We joined them for a nice late afternoon dessert in their garden with one daugher and the grandkids: a lovely afternoon. Next time we won't leave it to so late!</em></figcaption>

<h3>And some non-French real family that we were really happy to see.</h3>

    <figcaption><em>My nephew Scott and his wife Simone, who live a bit north of San Francisco. You know how it goes, we can't get to San Francisco to see them, so we meet in Paris! Sure, that's lot easier. We spent much of a day with Simone and Scott - a very enjoyable day. We're very grateful that they took so much time for us; I can tell you that their see-Paris schedule was full!</em></figcaption>
