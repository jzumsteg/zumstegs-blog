We came to Lerma because it was an easy drive from Zamora, it sounded kind of an interesting place, and it has a Parador said to be the best in Spain. (The Paradores are a chain of hotels owned by the Spanish government - more on the Paradores later). Right on the easy drive, right on the Parador, not-so-right on the "interesting place" part.

Lerma has a number of intersting old buildings and an old gate to the city, but the Parador is the star. But Lerma was a disappointment to us. We drove from Zamora on backroads, through beautiful fields of wheat on rolling hills; this is the breadbasket of Spanish agriculture. I envisioned Lerma as being a small town in this landscape; yes and no. It was a small town, but as we approached it we were directed onto the A1 Autopista - a six-lane highway between Madrid and Burgos, one of the busiest highways in Spain. Turns out that Lerma is about a mile away from the A1, and though we couldn't hear it and could barely see it from Lerma, its presence was ubiquitous; no matter how we tried we knew we weren't out in the country. An odd thing, but it definitely affected my feelings about the town.

The Duke of Alba, a powerful man in central Spain in the early 1600s, built his ducal palace here, primarily as a place that King felipe III could come and rest. The palace fell into disuse and thirty years ago, the parador chain took it over and converted it to a spectacular hotel. And somehow, we got an amazing room, in one of the four towers of the building. Pictures? You betcha!

In Lerma there are about eight restaurants and all of them are <em>asadores</em> - places that serve roast lamb and roast pig. By the way, this dish is for both of us.</em></figcaption>
