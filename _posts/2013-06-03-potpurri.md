<p>Easy day today, so I'll just make a few comments and post some pictures.</p>
<p>First accomplishment was to find a bricolage (hardware store) and buy a toilet seat, as the one in the main bathroom had broken. Found the store not too far away, found the plumbing section, found the toilet seats, found...Gasp! \\$55 for the cheapest decent one. Mary had warned us, but that still surprised us!</p>
<p>Then we walked in Saint-Mammès (pronounced "San mammae", accent on the last syllable). Laurie and I have always really liked the paintings of the Impressionist Alfred Sisley, so we were pleased to learn (at the houseboat recital) that Sisley had lived and painted here. We knew he lived for some years in the neighboring town of Moret-sur-Loing and planned to spend some time there, but today we came back to Saint-Mammès because the town has a Sisley walk, showing the locations of some of his paintings. Here's an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Sisly-1.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/Sisly-1.jpg" alt="Sisly 1" width="250" height="184" border="0" />A poor picture of a Sisley painting.</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Sisly-2.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/Sisly-2.jpg" alt="Sisly 2" width="250" height="166" border="0" />Walk into the courtyard of a building on the main street of Saint-Mammès, turn around, and here's what you see.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Saint-Mammès is a beautiful village, where the Loing River and Canal du Loing enter the Seine. As a result, it has for many years been a gathering place for the working boats on the Seine. </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img class="centeralign" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="boats.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/boats1.jpg" alt="Boats" width="500" height="333" border="0" />Boats on the Seine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="saint-mammes-2.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/saint-mammes-2.jpg" alt="Saint mammes 2" width="500" height="333" border="0" />Rue du Seine in Saint-Mammès, which looks out on the Seine River.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Later we walked along another section of Canal du Loing, as it enters Saint-Mammès. We watched a boat lock through, and found a plaque pointing out that Sisley had painted this very lock.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="sisley-3.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/sisley-3.jpg" alt="Sisley 3" width="250" height="174" border="0" /></p>
<p>Again, a poor reproduction of Sisley's picture.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="sisley-lock.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/sisley-lock.jpg" alt="Sisley lock" width="250" height="163" border="0" /></p>
<p>And the very same lock, today.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Later we walked along a part of the Canal du Loing and came to this lock. With views like this, any questions as to why we enjoy walking on the canal? </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="lock-1.jpg" src="http:/assets/images/2013/06/lock-11.jpg" alt="Lock 1" width="600" height="400" border="0" /></p>
<p>Weather has turned great - sunny and comfortably warm. We're planning a trip to Paris later this week. Can't wait!</p>
