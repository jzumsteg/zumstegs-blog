<p>Another of our favorite places is Dinan, in the northern part of Brittany. We came here two years ago and just loved it. Dinan is a medieval city, with walls and towers and many buildings looking just as they did 600-800 years ago, when they were built (the recorded history of one building goes back to 1224!). We returned this year and were not disappointed; in fact, we enjoyed this visit more. We did a couple new things, walked to a beautiful nearby town and, as before, just enjoyed being in this place.</p>
<h2>Around Dinan</h2>
<p>Dinan is a pretty interesting place to just stroll about. It has many buildings that have been here for hundreds of years.</p>

<h2>Walking the Walls of Dinan</h2>

<p>Dinan has been here a long time, and has the walls to prove it.</p>

<h3>Our River Cruise</h3>
<p>We read of a boat that daily comes from St. Malo up the Rance River to Dinan and thought that would be a cool thing to do. Maybe so, but it was also complicated, requiring taking a train to St. Malo early enough to get the boat, and there are no direct trains; figuring out the schedule which changes depending on tides at St. Malo (which is on the Atlantic coast); and then finding out that there wasn't even a boat scheduled for two of the three days we were in Dinan. So we walked down to the port where the boat arrived to see if we could get some more information and found  a one-hour boat ride on the Rance from the port, four times a day. Sign us up! We had a great boat "cruise" on the Rance.</p>

<p>That was our first morning in Dinan, and I'm not sure we could have found a better way to spend it. Tomorrow I'll post about our visit to Lehon, where we saw the abbaye.</p>
