I know, I know; it's been a while since I posted. We went to the small town of Saint-Pierre-Quiberon with our friends Jamie & Herv√© and Mary & Gilles and, believe it or not, the guest house (gite) at which we stayed had no Internet! I didn't know such places existed anymore!

But we had a fabulous time, and I'm working on a couple posts of our time there and our visit to Carnac. Soon, real soon now. As in, no later than tomorrow.
