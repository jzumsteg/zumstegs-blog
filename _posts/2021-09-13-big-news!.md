We each have a French Pass Sanitaire! Whenever we go into a restaurant or enclosed venue - think museums - with lots of people, we have to show our vaccination records. The French all have a QR code on their smartphones that the restaurant or venue staff check with an app - it shows that they have been vaccinated. This is the Pass Sanitaire.

Our vaccination records have worked almost 100% (we could not get into a museum in Strasbourg without a&nbsp;Pass Sanitaire, and it took some talking to get into the airshow I went to with Hervé), but we've had lots of "what is this thing?" looks when we showed our vaccination records rather than a pass.&nbsp;

We found out that in late August the French created a way to get our vaccination records into a Pass Sanitaire. So today Gilles and I did the on-line work to get it done and when I finished, Gilles said the site promised an answer in 48 hours. As it turned out, it took about 3 minutes to get a reply email with the QR code necessary. I downloaded the&nbsp;pass sanitaire&nbsp;app, scanned the code and - voilà - we are officially legal. This is not a huge thing, but it will be very nice to just go through the regular, well-known process and not have any questions.

A little thing, maybe, but Big News for us!
