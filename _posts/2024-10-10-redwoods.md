<h2>Sequoia Sempervirens - the Coastal Redwoods</H2>
We took a ramble to California recently and the first place we visited was the coastal redwoods in northern California. We spent two days walking through these beautiful trees.


A quick word about the redwoods. There are two different redwood species. <i>Sequoia Giganteum</i> lives on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California; <i>Sequoia Sempervirens</i> ("ever living") live in northern California near the coast. The <i>Sequoia Giganteum</i> are the largest trees in the world, measured by  volume. They grow to 300 feet and can have diameters at chest height of 25 feet. The coast redwoods - <i>Seqouia Sempervirens</i> - are not as big in volume, but are taller, often reaching 350 feet. The tallest tree in the world is a <i>Sempervirens</i>, at 380 feet.

What we know about the coast redwoods is that they are awe-inspiring. Standing in a grove of them, their trunks pushing up through the forest canopy so that it's hard to see their tops, feels the same as standing in a Gothic cathedral in France. Honestly, I can't find the words to describe how beautiful the redwood groves are and how deeply they touch Laurie and me. I think we will always make a stop in the redwoods on any trip south.

Since I can't describe these beautiful trees, I'll show some pictures. No camera in the world is going to do well at photographing something 350 feet tall, but I hope these pictures give you an idea of the beauty and peacefulness and serenity and pure awe that we feel when among them.

A sad note about the coastal redwoods: About 110,000 acres (44,000 hectares) of old-growth redwood forest exist in California and a small area of southern Oregon. That represents about 5% of old-growth redwood forests in 1900. The rest has been logged; given that a full-growth redwood can take 600-800 years to reach full height, the logged areas will not likely ever be redwood forests again. Fortunately, all of the old-growth redwood forest and about 380,000 acres of the second-growth forests are protected so there will always be some old-growth redwood forests; the parks we visited contain old-growth forests.
