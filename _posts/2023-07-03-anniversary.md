summary:  We celebrated our 55th anniversary with a very nice day in Brittany.
---  
We had a very nice anniversary&mdash;June 29&mdash;sharing it with Jamie and Herv√© at their house in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon. We went to a casual seafood restaurant, where we started with raw oysters and proceeded to lobster, washed down with a Muscadet <em>sur lie</em> (a little bit fizzy) wine: two hours of heaven. When we were finished Jamie asked about the lobster and the owner took us into the back and showed us all the tanks with lobster and crab and talked about where they get their lobster. Later we took a walk to the water, then shared a bottle of champagne. We could not have had a more enjoyable day to celebrate 55 years. 

55 years?!?! Yikes! We don't even feel that old!
