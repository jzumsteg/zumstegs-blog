Actually, Internet access chez Zumsteg came only five days late. It was the process:

- When Gilles first arranged with SFR (the provider), access was going to start May 24.

- Then I got a text saying I would have access sometime between May 24 and May 27.

- Then I got a letter saying my Internet access would start sometime in the next three weeks.

-Then I got a text saying that it would start sometime between 5/26 and 5/29.

- Then I got a text saying that they had to delay my access, they were working on it, and I could follow their progress on a website. Of course, I needed access to get to the website that would show their progress on getting me access...

- Gilles checked the website the very next morning, and it showed that the connection had been activated. I fussed around a bit with the router here at the house, and, sure enough, it worked.

Access here is via the phone lines, so it's not so fast as my access at home (in fact, it's about one-quarter as fast), but it's plenty fast for what I need here; I'm not going to be streaming any movies. And it includes a bunch of TV channels, and a land-line that has unlimited international calling. Cost is about \\$45 per month. So, all in all, a pretty good deal. Finally.
