summary: Yes, we're back in France and, yes, I have been derelict in posting. Here's a quick intro to our trip this year. Actual posts Real Soon Now
---  
We do this every two years - until we can figure out how to do it every year: we spend almost three months in France with a side trip to Spain for a week and a half or so. Right now, Friday, May 23, we're back in our French home-away-from-home, Bois-le-Roi. We arrived a little over a month ago, and immediately went off with friends Mary and Gilles to the area in Southeastern Fance around Avignon and Uz√©s. Then Laurie and I headed off to Spain for twelve days, followed by a few days with our friends <i>les Loustric</i> near the city of Pau, in the very southern part of France. 

Our first stop was the area around Avignon, so that's the first post. More will follow as I catch up - We've been here almost a month, so it'll take me a while to get up to date! In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the posts as I publish them.
