Last week, the Berlin Zumstegs descended on Montigny-sur-Loing. We were sooooooo glad to have them here and sooooooo sad to see them leave. Rather than a long, detailed and boring account of what we did, here are some pictures, mostly of Clara.

<h2>Birthday Princess</h2>
Clara's third birthday was Sepember 20, so we celebrated while she was here. She didn't seem to mind having another party.

<h2>Winding Down</h2>
Craig and Annie and Clara left Sunday; Monday we went to Paris for a couple nights. Now we're back in Montigny-sur-Loing, our home for almost five months. Sunday we'll shut the house up and return the keys and go to chez Germain; Monday the car goes back to Renault; Tuesday we return to Seattle.

It has been a great adventure, from start to finish, and while we'll be glad to return home, we will equally be sad to leave France. I'll likely post another "wrap-up" commentary soon, but I think this is the last newsy post. Sigh...
