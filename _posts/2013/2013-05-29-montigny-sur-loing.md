I'll tell you a bit about our "home" in France, Montigny sur Loing. We're about an hour south of Paris, by train or car (but who in their right mind would drive in Paris?). The town is about 2,800 people, though the daily population is some less than that, as many houses seem to be weekend homes and are closed up during the week.

Montigny has two restaurants, open only for lunch, two small general stores, and a boulangerie that our French friends pronounce to be far above average. My French has progressed to having an excellent grasp of all I need in the boulangerie, so my daily morning task is to walk down the street to the boulangerie and order a couple baguettes and a loaf of bread each morning.

The houses in Montigny range from "old French" to new and quite modern to very nice. Here are some pictures of houses in the town; see if you can guess which is chez Zumsteg:

This place is unbelievably quiet! At night there is simply no noise! (For the audiophiles among readers, our bedroom is 35db at night, with the window open.)

We've walked all over Montigny. It's just what we wanted: a small, old, quite pretty French village. Wouldn't mind a restaurant, though...
