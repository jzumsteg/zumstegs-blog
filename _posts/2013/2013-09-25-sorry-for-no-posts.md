I haven't posted for a while, because it has been a busy week or so. Last weekend we took off with Laurie's sister Peggy to see some chateaux in the Loire Valley (had a great time; pictures soon). Tuesday, Peggy headed back to Paris, just about the time I picked up Craig, Annie and Clara at Orly Airport. They'll be here until Sunday.

I promise I'll get some pictures up soon.

Can't believe it: we'll be back in Seattle two weeks from yesterday.
