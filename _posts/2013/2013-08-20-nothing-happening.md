We've just been hanging around, resting up and getting ready for our next ramble. Wednesday, we head south a bit with Mary and Gilles. We'll spend a couple days in Briare and a couple days in Bourges. We will also visit Sancerre, home of a great white wine. Not that we will indulge in any, of course...
