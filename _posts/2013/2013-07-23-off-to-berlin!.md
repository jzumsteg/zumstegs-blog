It's Sunday night; we're in Paris at Mary & Gilles flat, on our way to Berlin tomorrow. We're looking forward to seeing the "Red Tomato!"

Explanation: my Aunt Marjorie, after Craig, Annie and Clara spent three or four days at her house, called Clara "the Tornado." We added the "red" part, then Mary read an email about the "Red Tornado" and mis-read that phrase. She thought we'd called Clara "the Red Tomato." And so we've called her since.

Anyway, we'll be there mid-day tomorrow. We are sooooooooooooooo excited to see Craig and Clara. Annie is at a conference until Saturday (the Gordon Research Conference of Microbial Adhesion and Signal Transduction - those microbiologist know how to live large!), and we will be sooooooooooooooo happy to see her when she returns.

And we're excited to be back in Berlin. Although not high on most travelers' wish lists, we love Berlin and find it a fascinating city. I am sure I'll walk down my favorite street in the world - Karl Marx Allee, originally named Stalinallee when it was built in the early 1950s - at least once. Twice. Maybe three or four times. Photos to follow.
