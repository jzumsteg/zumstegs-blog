summary: Continuing our pastime of finding reminders of the ancient past, we went into the Fontainbleau Forest with Jamie and Hervé to see some prehistoric engravings on rocks there. Pretty dang interesting, we thought.

Our home base here, Bois-le-Roi, sits n the edge of the Fontainebleau Forest. This forest, 97 square miles, is owned and managed by the French governement, though for hundreds of years it was the private forest of the French kings ("Bois-le-Roi_ translates to "Forest of the King"). Today it is laced with trails, providing access to anyone from casual walkers to serious hikers and rock climbers.

The first inhabitants of the forest arrived some 40,000 years ago. Traces of these people have been found: stone tools and the bones of animals killed by hunters. Sometime around 9,000 BC these inhabitants started to carve engravings in the stone outcroppings common in the forest. Today, researchers have cataloged nearly 2,000 sites with these engravings. We visited one of these sites with Jamie and Hervé and I can tell you it was intriguing.

Finding these sites is not an easy task: the exact locations are available only to researchers, to reduce the possibility of vandalism. The only way to find them is to start looking, hiking in the forest and looking inside likely sites (most of the carvings are in small caves or under over-hanging rock formations, to protect them from the elements.) that is exactly what Hervé and his daughter Sophia did; they've found about 20 places with engravings.

We parked and started walking, first on a dirt road and then a trail. The first thing we came across was sobering: a site to 32 men executed by the Nazis jsut before the liberation of Fontainebleau. All were in the Resistance and the Nazis decided to execute Resistance members as the Allied forces advanced across France. 

After paying our respects, we continued. It was hot and a fair amount of the walk was on fine sand. Yes, you read that correctly: fine sand. Which tells us that the Fontainbleu Forest was once at the bottom of an ocean. This was, of course, millions of years ago&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;in this case 35 to 40 millions years ago. Interesting(?) fact: The sand of the Fountainbleau Forest is among the purest in the world and is, to this day, the only sand used by the glass-makers of Venice, on Murano Island.

"Enough trivia," I hear you say; "Let's see pictures of the engravings." Okay, okay, here you go:
