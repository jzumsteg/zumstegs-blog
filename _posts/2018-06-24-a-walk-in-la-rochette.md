As we have no rambles planned for the next two weeks, we'll be doing lots of walks and day-trips from our home-base here in Bois-le-Roi. I'm working on a post for just Bois-le-Roi so you can see where we are spending June (I'll do another for Samois-sur-Seine, to which we move next week). For now, though, a quick post about a walk.

Our route yesterday took us along the river in a neighboring town, La Rochette. There we saw a number of *affolantes*, houses that were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when this area - particularly on the Seine - became a preferred location for wealthy Parisians who could afford weekend/summer homes here. I've written about the affolantes before<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=3208">;</a> here are pictures of some we saw yesterday.
