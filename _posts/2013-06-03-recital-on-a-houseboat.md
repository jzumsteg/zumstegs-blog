<p>Really. Sunday, we were invited to a piano and voice recital on a houseboat in the beautiful small town of Saint-Mamm√®s. Here's a picture of the boat, from across the river:</p>

<p>The recital was piano and songs from the Belle Epoque (Beautiful Age), which is generally considered to be from around 1870 to the start of World War 1. The music was excellent and the setting unique. Only problem was that when we felt moved, we weren't sure whether is was by the music or the wake of a passing boat.</p>
