Brocante appears in the www.wordreference.com French-English dictionary translated as "bric-a-brac," "second-hand," and "junk." After visiting the Montigny-sur-Loing Brocante Nocturne ("nocturne" because it went from noon to midnight), I lean toward the third of those definitions.

Brocante seems to be a big deal here. Every town holds a Brocante day and the people who sell stuff at them seem to go from place to place, following the schedule. Honestly, I don't know how anyone makes any money at this, and I don't know why anyone would spend every Saturday setting up their stand and sitting, hoping for customers or why anyone would spend time looking at this huge collection of...er...junk.  But there are people who love searching the Brocantes, hoping, I guess, to find that remarkable bargain. Good luck with that, is my opinion.

Anyway, here are some pictures from Montigny's day (and night) in the Brocante spotlight.
