We've done most of our traveling in September, but some years ago we came to France in May and one strong memory we have of that trip was seeing the poppies in the fields. Last week, the poppies burst forth, and we love them as much now as then. Today, I have just poppie pictures, plus one other.

The road by which I took those pictures goes from the small town of La Genevraye to the even smaller town of Cugny. We've driven this road a couple times and were surprised to find it barricaded the day we went to see the poppies. A sign on the barricade said that the road was closed for a school outing and while we were there, sure enough, here came the school. Evidently they closed the road so the kids could have an outing of walking from La Genevray to Cugny and back. Is that cool or what?
