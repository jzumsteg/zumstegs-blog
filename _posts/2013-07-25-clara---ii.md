I promise that I'll post some non-Clara photos Real Soon Now. But yesterday, well, I accomplished a goal I've had for a long time, and Clara was part of it: we went to a Beer Garden that has a playground for kids. 

Now, honestly, can you imagine such a thing in the United States? But here it is, with a jumpy-house, and climbing toys and areas for kids to run around in.
[gallery columns = "2" size = "medium" link="files" ids="1155,1152"]


<figure class = "landscape">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/2013/07/DSC03623.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl  }}" alt="Image" />
		<figcaption><em>See the jumpy-house in the background?</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class = "portrait">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/2013/07/DSC03614.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl  }}" alt="Image" />
		<figcaption><em>With actual beers, which were quite tasty.</em></figcaption>
</figure>


And, of course, while I was there, I had to take a few pictures of Clara.  
<figure class = "portrait">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/2013/07/DSC03619.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl  }}" alt="Image" />
		<figcaption><em></em></figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class = "portrait">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/2013/07/DSC03618.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl  }}" alt="Image" />
		<figcaption><em></em></figcaption>
</figure>


Ok, now I'm going to work on a post about Karl-Marx-Allee and Ernst Thallman. Bet you can't wait, eh?
