I promise that I'll post some non-Clara photos Real Soon Now. But yesterday, well, I accomplished a goal I've had for a long time, and Clara was part of it: we went to a Beer Garden that has a playground for kids. 

Now, honestly, can you imagine such a thing in the United States? But here it is, with a jumpy-house, and climbing toys and areas for kids to run around in.

And, of course, while I was there, I had to take a few pictures of Clara.

Ok, now I'm going to work on a post about Karl-Marx-Allee and Ernst Thallman. Bet you can't wait, eh?
