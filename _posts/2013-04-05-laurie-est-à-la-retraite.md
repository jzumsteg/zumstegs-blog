<p>Hard to believe, but after twenty years, Laurie retired last Monday. Tuesday she was pretty exhausted, both physically - from cleaning out her desk - and emotionally - from having everyone in the library, co-workers and patrons, come to say good-bye to her.</p>
<p>It will take her some getting used to it, certainly. We were talking about doing something and she said that we should wait until the weekend; I pointed out that, from now on, every day is a weekend day. "Oh…yeah…that's right…"</p>
<p>Tonight is the going-away party. Her colleagues decided to do it on a Friday off-site so they could have a real party, rather than treats in a library meeting room. Should be fun...no really, library parties can be fun. Honestly.</p>
