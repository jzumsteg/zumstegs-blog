I'm writing this from home, back in Renton. We flew from Paris to St. Louis four weeks ago, spent a week with Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry, then came home three weeks ago. Are we happy to be back? Yes, as always. Were we sorry to leave France? Yes, as always. Sorry to leave St. Louis and Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry? Yes, as always.
<h2>The Return</h2>
Sunday, Oct. 17 we got up about 7 in the morning, finished packing, cleaned the cottage that had been our home for two and a half months, and headed off to the airport. We had everything we needed, including &nbsp;COVID-19 tests done three days before, a "Letter of Attestation" swearing that we had not been around anyone with COVID recently, passports, boarding passes, etc. The drive, planned for a Sunday morning to avoid what can be horrendous traffic, was okay except for some horrendous traffic caused by an accident. But we had plenty of time so *pas de problem*.

We got to the car-return place, turned in the car, shuttled to the airport, checked the bags, went through passport control in about two minutes and then hit security. Ugh! Long lines, surly employees, and a continuous request for some document or other: COVID test, now the Attestation form, now boarding cards (two or three times), a hand check of my laptop bag, boarding passes again, etc. Just tiring.

Flight to Atlanta was fine, went through Global Entry (Immigration and Passport control) in about 2 minutes (if you're traveling internationally, spend the time and money to get Global Entry; well worth it), thirty minute wait for bags which we then immediately put on a conveyor belt to go to the connecting flight, another poor experience going through security (no TSA PreCheck), and a two and a half hour wait for the flight to St. Louis.

We got to St. Louis and had a wonderful surprise when Clara was at the airport (with Craig) at midnight to meet us. She had blue-green hair, and I didn't recognize her for a few seconds! Then, hugs all around. It was a wonderful welcome to see her there.

Usually when we arrive at Craig and Annie's, it's a drink and then bed. This time we skipped the drink. We had been up for almost exactly 25 hours and were physically and mentally whupped. I think we slept until about 10 the next morning.

I'll post a report on our week in St. Louis (spoiler alert: we had a great time!)
<h2>A Quick France Summary</h2>
What was the best thing about our two and a half months in France? Spending more time than ever with our French "family." When we planned this trip, we said the thing we wanted to do most was spend more time with our friends there; often they're on vacation or busy or we're off on some ramble; this trip we wanted to see them more. Well, we succeeded! All our friends made time for us - the first week we had a gathering the first night, the second night and the fifth night, and things didn't slow down too much from there.&nbsp;

So, Mary and Gilles, Jamie and Hervé, Pierre and Penny, Yves and Valerie, Riitta and Benôit, Lesly and Pierre: merci à vous for making our stay the best ever. We just can't thank all of you enough for including us in so many wonderful, happy, memorable times. You're the best! We miss you all!
