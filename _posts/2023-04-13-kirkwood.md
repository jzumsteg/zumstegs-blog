Believe it or not, we're doing that "Summer in France" thing again. This week, we're in St. Louis, visiting Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry. After the Winter and Spring in Seattle, St. Louis has been a delight: 70s for temps, clear skies, warm evenings. We've been eating dinner on the deck. Craig points out that this is the best time of the year for doing that: warm but not too hot or humid, and the bugs aren't out yet. 

Our big adventure yesterday was a trip to the Apple Store. Laurie's iPad - ten years old - died a natural death when we fired it up Monday. I was able to resurrect it after a frustrating day of technical trial-and-error but it's so old that Gmail wil not work on it, so it was off to the Apple Store which is fortunately, about ten minutes away. That's about the same amount of time we spent in the store, leaving with a nice new iPad and a depleted bank account. Man, they make it easy to spend a wad of cash! Anyways, she's back online and I guarantee that it cost less than if we'd had to replace the iPad in France!
