We're back in the good old US of A and visiting Craig and Annie and Clara and the newest Zumsteg, Henry. This is totally fun, and makes leaving France easier. Without further blather, here're some pictures.
<h2>Clara's birthday</h2>
Clara celebrated her 5th birthday on September 20, so we brought an extended birthday celebration for her. Craig and Annie said that Clara had coveted a role-playing kit, in this case a Hair Dresser's outfit - yes, really. So we gave her that and it was a hit!

First, on with the outfit.

Then, of course, everybody had to get their hair cut. This was, to say the least, a riot!

	<figcaption><em>Do not - really, do not - ask or comment on Granddad getting his haircut. Clara seemed to think it was slightly humorous. Granddad was not so sure...</em></figcaption>

Phew, we all survived, but amazingly enough, Clara decided the next night that we all needed haircuts again. I'm going to be bald by the time I get home.
<h2>And...announcing Henry George Zumsteg!</h2>
Henry was born August 12, so he is seven weeks old. He is the smilingest seven week old kid I've ever seen. All you have to do is smile at him and he grins right back. Here's Henry:

It has been nothing but fun to see Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry. I could post another 300-400 pictures, but I think that might bore a few people.

Tomorrow we head back to Seattle, about 145 days after we left. We like these long vacations; might do it again next year...
