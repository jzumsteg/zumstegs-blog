<p class="p1">Yep, we’re in France again. In fact, we’ve been here almost two weeks, having arrived Wednesday, May 16. That means that, yes, I’m way behind posting to this world-famous - well, regionally well-known - travel blog. I’ll use the excuse that I’ve been busy traveling; yeah, that’s my story and I'm sticking to it.</p>
First, our itinerary for this summer:

May 8: we left Seattle for New York.
May 9 - 15: serious grandchild-squeezing with Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry in New York. Pictures to follow, of course.
May 15: off to France. An uneventful flight after sitting at JFK airport and watching a horrendous storm pass over the airport, so bad that the airport closed for about an hour.
May 20: Off on a ramble to the Southwest of France. Pictures to follow.
May 20 - August 21: Hang around France, eat some cheese, drink some wine, see some sights, Pictures to follow.
August 21: Off to Spain for three weeks. We'll drive from our home base in Bois-le-Roi/Samois-sur-Seine, visiting places we've been been to before: Zamora, Trujillo, Vejer-de-la-Frontera, Ùbeda and Segovia. Kind of a "greatest hits" tour, as these are our favorite small towns in Spain.
September 13: back to New York.
September 19: back to Seattle.

Should be fun...I hope you'll follow along with us.
