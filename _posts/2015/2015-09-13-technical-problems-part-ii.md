This morning I ran into the same technical problems as I had in early July, so if pictures - particularly in the Venice post - are gone, bear with me. I'll get them back, but it may take a day or two.

Update Monday, 9/14. All is well, technical-wise. My Internet provider did a fine job getting emails back, and I was able to rebuild the photo directory for the blog, so all is well. Still, the ISP has some 'splainin' to do, and I've told them to get as technical as they need to - I'll understand - but they have to figure out why I've had emails and photos disappear twice now and what they're doing to ensure it doesn't happen again. We'll see...I'm going to get pretty ornery if they slough me off with the "it was just a glitch" line.
