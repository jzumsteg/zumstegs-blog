These pictures were taken from our bedroom windows at 9:58 last night.

Sunset is at 9:56 here right now; it'll be a couple minutes laterÂ after the solstice June 21. We like that. Given the clear skies we've had in the evenings, it means that it's light enough to do things outdoors until 10:30, and there's still light in the sky at 11.

Sunrise is about 5:57, but I wouldn't know that by observation. We're on vacation: we're not sleeping in late, but we're also not getting up very early. Why would we?
