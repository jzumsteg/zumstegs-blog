Life can be complicated here, even in simple things. When I say that to people who have lived here a long time, I sometimes get some pushback: "No, it's not that bad. Not so complicated. Used to be worse," etc. Right. Here's complicated.

Tonight Mary and Gilles are having a dinner gathering for us, another couple and, of course, them. Laurie asked if we could bring a dessert and Mary said, "Bien sûr!" So this morning we went to get a cake at the bakery. There is a boulangerie/patisserie that we know has excellent cakes near the cheese shop in Bois-le-Roi, and as we needed some cheese we decided to go there.

Whoops. Closed: *de vacances* for three weeks. Okay, there's another bakery in town so we'll go there.

Whoops. Closed: this particular bakery is closed every Wednesday, an important fact that we didn't know. Well, there's a good bakery in our current hometown, Samois-sur-Seine, that we know is open on Wednesdays, so we'll go back there.

Whoops. Closed: sign in the window says, "Closed this Wednesday morning *uniquement*." Closed just this particular Wednesday, just for us. Okay, now we know there's a bakery in Samoreau, a ten-minute drive away. We do not know if it's closed for vacation or closed on all Wednesdays or closed this Wednesday *uniquement*. Off we go.

It's open! Yahooo! And parking right across the street! Whoo-hoo! And...they have no cakes. Really. They do, fortunately, have a selection of beautiful tartes, of which we buy six and call it a day.

Complicated. Let's go buy a cake. Four bakeries later we have dessert, but no cake. Complicated.
