Okay, our trip to Saint-Pierre-Quiberon requires a little up-front explaining, as most of you know Laurie and I are not beach people, and Saint-Pierre-Quiberon is most definitely a beach community.

Our friends Jamie and Hervé Rufin have been vacationing in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon for seven or eight years, and raving about how much they love it there. This year we were in France when they went to Saint-Pierre, so they invited us to join them (and our other French friends Mary and Gilles). Because our Berlin trip had already been scheduled and booked, we were able to spend only three nights with les Rufin, so we also booked a hotel for two more nights, after they and the Germains left. We knew we would have a wonderful time with les Rufin and les Germain but, honestly, we weren't too sure about Presq'ile Quiberon.

Well, not to worry; we did, indeed have a wonderful time with the Rufin family (daughter Sophia and son Alex were with us there) and the Germains.  We also learned why Jamie and Hervé return to this place: it is just beautiful and charming and fun and all the things a special vacation place needs to be. We returned today (August 4) and we were quite glad that we woke up to rain, because we would have hated to leave if the weather had been good, as it was when we were there.

Rather than boring you again with lots of words, I'm just going to post some pictures. All I can say now is that we are so thankful that Jamie and Hervé asked us to share their "special place" with them, and that we hope we can do it again in the coming years. This is a part of France I'm not sure we would have seen had it not been for Jamie and Hervé inviting us and urging us to join them, but I can tell you that Saint-Pierre-Quiberon has become a special place for us, too.

<h3>Saint-Pierre-Quiberon and the Bay</h3>
Some sights around the town. We all went swimming in the bay and I have to say that, after that initial getting-wet shock, it was wonderful. Been a long time since we swam in salt water; I hope it isn't so long to the next time.

<h3>The Cote Sauvage</h3>
That translates as the "wild coast" and wild it is. Believe it or not, Hervé, Alex and I went swimming in this surf!
