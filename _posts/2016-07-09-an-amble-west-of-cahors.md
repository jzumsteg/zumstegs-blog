We found a suggested route to the small towns on the Tarn River west of Cahors, so off we went.

I've mentioned that we like bridges; here's an old suspension bridge across the Tarn River.

See, nothing very special on this amble around the countryside. But we had a very nice day and ended it with a late lunch at this beautiful restaurant. It was located in a tiny village, and was one of the best lunches we've ever had. It was also one of the most expensive lunches, but what the heck: we're in France where Sunday lunches are actually dinners, and we sat outdoors and had a fine time.
