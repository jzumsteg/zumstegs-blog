In blog posts of previous trips here I've written some about Bois-le-Roi, which is where we stay when we do one of the long-stay trips. But maybe there are some new people to this blog and who haven't fled yet, so I'm going to post a short description of Bois-le-Roi (and at the end, I'll include links to earlier posts about this town).

Bois-le-Roi ("forest of the king") is about 35 miles south of Paris. About 6,000 live here, and an important attraction is that Bois-le-Roi has a station the railroad line to Paris. That trip takes about 35 minutes, with one stop, and trains run almost every half hour. That makes Bois-le-Roi desirable place to live. It also makes it a desirable place to park for a commuter and that can be a problem!

The town has been settled forever; there are Roman records from 52 B.C. indicating a settlement here.
