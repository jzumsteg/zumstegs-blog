I know it's been a while, but don't despair - posts are coming Real Soon Now. We were supposed to have Internet access atÂ chez Zumsteg last Wednesday, then it was re-scheduled for some time between Friday and Monday, and today I got a message that it would be sometime between Monday and Wednesday. I have also received a snail-mail letter that it will be sometime in the next two weeks. So who knows. And this is with an existing line into the house - no installation required.

Stayed tuned...
