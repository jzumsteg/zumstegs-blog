First, the update: the European news agency Reuters reports that the French air traffic controllers have called off their strike this weekend. We haven't seen any corroboration of that and until I see it on the Air France site, I won't be 100% convinced, but at least there's some hint of good news.

In the meantime, Grandkid Pics! After all, that's what you're here for, is it not?

Clara's Daisy Girl troop was at the Memorial Day Parade which, because of nasty weather, was held in the local fire station.
