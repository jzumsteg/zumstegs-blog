I don't think we'll get to all the cheeses in France, but we're making an effort. Today:

Roquefort Vernieres
Reblochon
Crottin de Cavignol -  a famous chevre
Salers - never tried this one, but very similar to Cantal, which we like a lot. Actually, we like all them a lot.
Tommes de Savoie - had this last week and loved it, so what the heck: we'll have some more

We also bought a slab of paté de campagne.

Can't wait for lunch!

On the cheese place, clockwise from the top: Salers, Reblochon, Crottin de Cavignol, Roquefort, Tommes de Savoie. French readers are now saying, "What? Cheese and paté at lunch? On a weekday? Quelle horreur! An advantage of being non-French and on vacation: we eat what we want when we want.
