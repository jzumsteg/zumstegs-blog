French air traffic controllers are going on strike this weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We leave here Friday, so things may be a little difficult. We likely won't know what's happening until Friday morning. Travel can be such fun, especially when the strike-happy French decide that it's time for a few days off.
