A week ago, June 29, Laurie and I celebrated our 50th *anniversaire de mariage*. We were perfectly okay with that until I mentioned that we've been married half a century. That took away both our breaths!

Our French family gave a lovely party for us - fourteen people - on Jamie and Herv√©'s beautiful new terrace; lots of champagne and lovely wine, excellent food and, best of all, wonderful conversations with great folks. We could not have had a better way to celebrate this momentous event.

Fifty years! I say it's been easy for me, but I don't know how Laurie did it. Unfortunately, when I say that, she agrees! The fact is, it's been a great half-century, and we are looking forward to the next 50 years.
