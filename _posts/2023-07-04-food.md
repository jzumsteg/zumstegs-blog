summary: A few pictures of foods that we've encountered in Sicily, Spain and France.
---  
We have, indeed, had some dang good food on this trip. We know some real "foodies" who would like me to take and post pictures of every meal we've had; sorry to disappoint you. I don't feel 100% comfortable taking out my phone or camera and besides, I'm usually so eager to tuck into the food that I forget. But I have a few that you might enjoy.
<h2>Sicily</H2>
Being an island, you might think that Sicily has good seafood. You would be 100% right. Everywhere we found great seafood. Over our Sicilian stay we had twelve dinners; we had seafood as the main dish for eleven of those dinners; for most of them we also had seafood for the first course. We could not, unfortunately, find any seafood desserts. 

(The one non-seafood dinner was a night we stayed at an "agrotourist" place which served dinner. There we had a wonderful pasta for the first course and a main plate of the best Italian sausage known to man.)

    <figcaption><em>A crazy lunch in Palermo. This was a stand, essentially, in a big open-air market. Plates were on a big table - you chose what you wanted, the staff heated them up and brought them to your table, which was outdoors in the market, with folks streaming by. It didn't cost much and it was pretty good.</em></figcaption>

    <figcaption><em>Laurie? She had a rather large plate of calamari. She says it was excellent and I can tell you that she's an expert on calamari, having it darn near every chance she gets.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

We also had some rather good desserts in Sicily. In several places the dessert choices included a dish that took some traditional Sicilian dessert and "re-imagined" it, creating something with the same elements but in a completely different form. Now, we would call the result a "de-constructed" dessert, but somehow the translation for these described them as "decomposed." Not the image you want, but the desserts were excellent.

That's a sampling of Sicilian food. We enjoyed our time in Sicily a lot and the seafood was a huge contributor to that enjoyment. It was night after night of superb seafood at almost unbelievably low prices. I think we'd go back just to eat!

<h2>Spain</h2>
I posted some pictures of meals we had in Spain (see: [Sos del Rey Católico]({% post_url 2023-05-21-sos %})), so I won't post but a couple more here.

Vegetarian alert: Spain may not be the country for you. Lamb and pig are the stars of much of Spanish cuisine, almost always roast suckling lamb and pig. The lambs and pigs are milk-fed and butchered at a young age, and the meat is fall-off-the-fork tender and really tasteful. We had <em>lots</em> of lamb while in Spain.

    <figcaption><em>Well, kind of food related: a market stand in Lerma. As in markets in France, the produce and fruit is unbelievably fresh, picked the day before at the most and sometimes, I suspect, early morning of market day. These markets appear in a town once or twice a week, and the vendors go to one each day of the week, in different towns.</em></figcaption>

    <figcaption><em>A mess of small lamb chops. There were about ten on each plate.</em></figcaption>

<h2>France</H2>
The cuisines of France and Spain differ greatly. Spain cuisine leans toward simpler ways to cook something - roasting being a top choice - and doing it perfectly. France cuisine is more sophisticated, with sauces and preparations that introduce nuances to the texture and flavor of a dish.  

Let's start with a dish that has become crazily popular in France: the hamburger. As you can see, not exactly like an American burger - we haven't seen one yet that you can pick up and eat. A French hamburger is a knife-and-fork endeavour.

    <figcaption><em>We've seen taller!</em></figcaption>
</figure>

The singular most served meal in French restaurants is <em>steak frites</em>. No wonder - it is pretty much always excellent.

    <figcaption><em>Italian food is popular in France. I don't know if it's "authentic" Italian food, as it often has a French flair to it, but I can tell you it's delicious. This is a dish of lasagne at a Paris restaurant where we know the summer maitresse d'. Laurie is laughing at the size of the serving. (She finished it.)</em></figcaption>

<h3>Our Last Lunch in France</h3>
We went to a small restaurant&mdash;<em>Le Galois sur le Grille</em>&mdash;in Barbizon, near Bois-le-Roi, with friends Anne-Marie and David. This is the kind of restaurant, common in France, that you'd walk by unless you knew about it. We had a fabulous lunch.

    <figcaption><em>A person could easily walk by La Galois sur le Grill. There's no indication that the restaurant has a beautiful covered terrace and serves top-notch meals of meat (mostly) and fish. </em></figcaption>
</figure>
Though not exactly food-related, I want to post a picture of our ride to the restaurant today:
<figure class = 'landscape' >
    <img src="{{ "food/IMG_5852.jpg" | prepend: site.imageurl | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="Image" />
    <figcaption><em>Yep, a Rolls-Royce. Two tons, with a 650-hp engine; it's a rocket. We've never even ridden in a Roller until today, and then David let me drive it back. What fun! One of Anne-Marie and David's sons, clearly successful in his business endeavours, gave it to them. I've mentioned that to Derek and Craig, but they do not seem to have gotten the hint...</em></figcaption>
</figure>
Our first course was <em>Oeufs Murrette</em>, eggs poached in red wine, made in this restaurant with lardon (a bacon-like meat) and chorizo. I completely forgot to take a picture because it looked so tasty I couldn't wait to start. 

Second course for all of us was <em>Filet Mignon de Porc</em>. Laurie and I had ours with <em>frites</em>, Anne-Marie with vegetables and David with <em>purée</em> (seasoned mashed potatoes). We got a lot of pork for the price!

    <figcaption><em>The pork had a Dijon mustard-based sauced and was just fabulous </em></figcaption>

    <img src="{{ "food/IMG_5830.jpg" | prepend: site.imageurl | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="Image" />
    <figcaption><em>Restaurants often offer <em>Café Gourmand</em> which is a sampling of mini-sized versions of their most popular desserts and a cup of coffee. </em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class = 'portrait' >
    <img src="{{ "food/IMG_5831.jpg" | prepend: site.imageurl | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="Image" />
    <figcaption><em>David's "Fontainbleau."</em></figcaption>

<figure class = 'landscape-medium-width' >
    <img src="{{ "food/IMG_5832.jpg" | prepend: site.imageurl | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="Image" />
    <figcaption><em>This dessert was called "<em>Cake aux cherises</em>" (cherries, which are in season here now). Laurie and I each had one and it was mighty good. </em></figcaption>
</figure>

You would be right in thinking this isn't an inexpensive eat-and-run meal. Three courses of excellent food, coffee and sharing a bottle of wine was about $115 per couple. But this is a full three-course dinner; we just had it at lunch. We certainly have paid more than that in Seattle for a dinner that wasn't as good, so I'm thinking France isn't as expensive as many people think.

<h3>Speaking of Desserts...</h3>
I'm skipping right to desserts, because desserts.

    <figcaption><em>Ile Flottante is a old traditional French dessert. This was a "re-imagined" version: that's a coffee macaroon on top, and the sauce in which the ile "floats" was coffee rather than the usual creme anglaise. It was mighty tasty. </em></figcaption>

    <figcaption><em>The green thing on the left is a "salambo", also called "glans". It is filled with a thick custard. Craig loves them. I like them a lot but couldn't eat more than one while Craig could devour half a dozen I'm sure. On the right is a "tarte citron" - lemon tart - a very traditional dessert tart.</em></figcaption>

I apologize to you foodies for not having more photos of your favorite subject. I'll see if I can do better over the last three weeks of our stay here.
