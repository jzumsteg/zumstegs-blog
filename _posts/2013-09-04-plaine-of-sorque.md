The weather has turned hot again - mid-80s today; we're keeping the strenuous activity to a minimum and to the morning. This morning we returned to an area near us that is designated as a nature preserve: the Plaine of Sorque.

Once, this area was mostly stone quarries. A particularly beautiful sandstone was quarried here until the 1960s from open-air pits. But evidently sandstone fell out of favor, or the supply was used up because in the 1950s and 1960s, the quarries closed, leaving large holes in the ground, which quickly filled with water.

Someone decided that these lakes could form the central part of a great bird preserve, so the land around them was allowed to return to its native state. Trails were created, and two observation platforms, with camouflage and holes to look out and use for cameras, were built on the shore of the largest lake. The trail goes along the Loing River for quite a ways, too. It is really a beautiful place to visit.
