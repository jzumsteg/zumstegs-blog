No, we haven't made it to France, yet. We're in Elmsford, NY, with the East Coast Z's. We arrived Monday and will be here until mid-day tomorrow - Thursday, 5/14 - when we head for JFK and that Air France monster.

Since IÂ know that both you readers of this blog really want to see pictures of Clara...

We arrive in France Friday morning about 11:30 pm Seattle time. I'll post when I've recovered from the flight.
