In 2013, when we were planning for our first long-stay here, I read about towns around our 2013 homebase in Montigny-sur-Loing. The town of Moret-sur-Loing looked interesting, especially when I read that Alfred Sisley, long one of our favorite Impressionist painters, lived here, died here and is buried in the local cemetery. So we made an early trip to Moret, fell in love with it, have visited it many times since, and love it more every time we're there. This morning, we made yet another visit, so I want to post a lot of pictures of our visit. In a country of beautiful and interesting small towns, this is our favorite. This post will be mostly pictures; hope that's okay.

	<figcaption><em>This building was built by a wood carver. No surprise, eh? Built in the 1600s.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

</figure>



The plaque says that on the night of March 19, 1815, Napoleon slept here as he traveled to Paris after leaving his first exile on the island of Elba. Now, "Napoleon slept here" is similar to our "George Washington slept here" (if either of them actually slept in every place that claims that, they would both have lived to be 300 years old), but I think this one is fairly well documented.

<h2>Alfred Sisley</h2>
Alfred Sisly painted some 500 pictures in Moret-sur-Loing and the surrounding area. In Moret and the surrounding towns there are plaques showing a picture he painted from that place. Here's an example;

<figure class = "landscape">
	<img src="{{"/assets/images/2018/07/DSC05409.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="Image" />
	<figcaption><em>A plaque showing a painting by Alfred Sisley, one of the original (and, in our humble opinion, one of the best) Impressionists.</em></figcaption>
</figure>



<figure class = "landscape">
	<img src="{{"/assets/images/2018/07/DSC05410.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" alt="Image" />
	<figcaption><em>The view today from where Sisley set up his easel.</em></figcaption>
</figure>



Pretty cool, eh?

Laurie and I have taken to visiting the graves of people we admire, so of course, we visited Sisley's grave. Nice to tell him in person that we love his paintings.

			<figcaption><em>Alfred Sisley's grave. I know it looks odd, but after spending much of his life here and painting in the Forest of Fontainebleau, he asked that a stone from that forest be placed on his grave. Done.</em></figcaption>

			<figcaption><em>Alfred Sisley's grave. The quote says," Objects must be enveloped in light as they are in nature." There's not a better definition of Impressionism.</em></figcaption>

It amazes us to think that Sisley's paintings sold for the equivalent of a few hundred dollars in his time. Now? Sell your house for a small one.
<h2>L'Eglise Notre Dame</h2>
Moret's church fascinates us. It is gothic, built in the late-twelfth century. Where many churches of that time are gone, or have been added to and changed, or over-restored, L'Eglise de Notre Dame just is. Not much changed, except for a few modifications to keep it standing, it shows what churches of that time looked like. We find it lovely.

And for our organ-playing friend, Margaret:

Some sights from the "back streets" of Moret:

The plaque below says "1638 Sucre d'Orge des Religeuses de Moret." It was in this building that nuns created the barley-sugar candy for which Moret is famous (sort of). They invented it in 1638!

<figure class = "landscape">

	<figcaption><em>An old sign of a shop here.

Just a couple more pictures...

That's Moret-sur-Loing. We will be back here, many times, I suspect. It's a lovely small town, not overrun with tourists, though more people should come to see it. This is France at its best.
