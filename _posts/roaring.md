summary: Roaring exhibit at St. Louis Art Museum
---  
Before we headed off to Frande, we spent a week in St. Louis - actually, the suburb of Kirkwood, where Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry live. As always, we had a great time - ate like monarchs, saw cool things, did fun stuff. One especially cool activity was a visit to the St. Louis Art Museum, to see an exhibition of great interest to us.

A word or two about the St. Louis Art Museum (also know as SLAM): it is a great museum, especially for a smaller city like St. Louis.
