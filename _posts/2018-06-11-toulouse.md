We spent three days in Toulouse with Mary and Gilles. Toulouse is a big city, home to Airbus (a tour guide asked us where we all were from and when Laurie and I said, "Seattle," her immediate response was, "Oh...Boeing"). Lots of interesting things to see, a river to walk by, a canal in the middle of town, and many beautiful buildings. Toulouse is known as the "Rose City" for it's buildings of reddish-pink brick. We enjoyed Toulouse. I'm not going to write a lot about it; just show some pictures.
