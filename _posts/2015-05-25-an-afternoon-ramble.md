Last Saturday Gilles was set to watch an important Rugby match of his favorite team, from his hometown area of Clermont-Ferrand. Knowing that it would be a really good idea for us to be absent during the match, Mary, Laurie and I set off for Égreville, to see some beautiful countryside and to visit a garden of sculptures by Antoine Bourdelle.

Antoine Bourdelle worked in Paris in the late 1800s and early 1900s, until his death in 1929. He seems well known here, but I don't think I'd heard of him before; but then, I am not well-versed in the world of sculpture, so my ignorance isn't any reflection on Bourdelle's place in the art world.

Anyway, when he died, his daughter and son-in-law, who lived in the small town of Égreville, about an hour south of Paris, created a beautiful garden with 56 of his sculptures and bas-reliefs. It really is a beautiful and peaceful place and it was a perfect afternoon outing for us.

Laurie liked this sculpture of the famous dancer Isador Duncan best. It's small - about 3 feet high -  but we still couldn't fit it into the car.
