You may recall from my earlier post that we loved La Rochelle. So much so that we returned last week for another stay, three days this time. I am glad to report that we still love La Rochelle.

One thing about La Rochelle is that its main purpose for existing is to serve seafood to as many people as possible. And I mean great seafood - always fresh.

Now, Friday was Laurie's birthday and we had to celebrate. It's not everyday that one celebrates his or her 40th birthday, and I can tell you that Laurie didn't celebrate her 40th that day either. Anywhooo, I had to find a special place for a birthday dinner, a place with that certain je ne sais quoi, the greatest in a city of great restaurants. I looked, I researched, I checked them out, and finally, I found it:

	<figcaption><em>Le P'tit Bleu - nothing but the best.</em></figcaption>
</figure>



You can see that the "dining room" of Le P'tit Bleu is a bunch of tables along side the old harbor.

Now, you may be laughing (or crying) but I'll tell you that the moules (mussels) we had there were fantastic; they are cooked on a grill while you wait and served up too hot to eat for a few minutes. Here's Laurie tucking in:

	<figcaption><em>Moules - Mmmmmmmm.</em></figcaption>
</figure>



Here's a picture of the view. The tower in the background was built in the 1400s.

Le P'tit Bleu is not the only restaurant in La Rochelle; there must be hundreds of them. This is truly a city dedicated to seafood.

Some more La Rochelle pictures. I didn't take so many this trip, as I took hundreds last time we were here.

So we still do love this city and, honestly, can't imagine coming to France without a detour down to La Rochelle. Want to see more La Rochelle pix? Check out the <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=769" title="La Rochelle">La Rochelle</a> post from July.
