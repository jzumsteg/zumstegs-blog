<h2>The California Redwoods</H2>
Our friends Shelley and Eric went to their family condo in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, so Laurie and I invited ourselves (again). Believe it or not, Shelley and Eric said, "Sure, c'mon over," so we did. First, though, we made a detour to Casper and then Cheyenne.

In Casper we visited the National Historic Trails Museum. The four main trails of the westward migration passed through Casper (the trails are the Oregon Trail, California Trail, Mormon Trail and the route of the Pony Express; actually all four of these trails followed essentially the same route from Missouri to southwest Idaho, where they separated). This is an excellent museum and if you ever find yourself near Casper and have any interest at all in this part of our country's history, a visit to this museum is well worth the time.
