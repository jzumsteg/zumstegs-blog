When we were here two years ago, the first six weeks we had miserable weather: wet and cold almost the entire time. This trip, not so much. We've had a couple cloudy days, about two hours of light rain, and here's this week's forecast:

I'm okay with hot weather, so I'll be okay, but Laurie wilts. I suspect we'll be taking some long drives in our air-conditioned car this week. Or spending aÂ lot of time the Carrefour market, which is kept so cold we wear fleece jackets there, no matter the time of day.
