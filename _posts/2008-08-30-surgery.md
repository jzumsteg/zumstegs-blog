## Background ##
In October of 2007 I had some rather serious surgery on a tumor and cyst growing in my medulla - the part of the brain that controls breathing and heartrate and other automatic functions. Spoiler alert, all came out fine: the tumor was benign, the neurosurgeon was able to get it out completely. I was left with some residual effects: I have no sense of touch or fine motor skills in the fingers and thumb of my right-hand and the bottom of my right foot, and there are some large parts of my right side with little or no feeling. But you know what? Those things are just annoyances - I'm healthy otherwise and I wouldn't have been if we hadn't taken the tumor out.

I kept a blog during the surgery and recovery time - Derek posted while I was actually in the operating room. Since this current blog is a travel blog more or less, this seems like an odd place for posts about the surgery, but this blog is also a tool for remembering things and I don't want to keep multiple blogs, so here it is. 

Please feel free to skip reading this completely. I will not be offended in the least!
