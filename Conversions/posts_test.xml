		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're ready! Got our flights booked and leased a car for the time we're there.

Flights are on British Airways, Seattle - London, couple hours in Heathrow, then Heathrow - Paris. We'll get in around 5 in the afternoon. Mary and Gilles will be there to meet us; we think they'll bring a large delivery van to carry our luggage. British Airways allows one large suitcase each, and then charges $50 for the second large suitcase, which is much less than shipping a suitcase-sized box of stuff over ($180). So we're going to have four big-as-allowed suitcases.

We are leasing a car from Renault. Renault, and other European auto companies, have a plan whereby you can do a short-term lease (at least 21 days); you get a brand-new car, fully-insured, for quite a good rate. It's not a great deal if you're staying for a shorter stay because the rate is high for the first 21 days, but after that, it's $18 per day, fully insured. For our stay, that works out to be almost exactly $25 per day for the five months, and that is an unbeatable rate. Our car will be a Clio4 (you can see it at http://www.renault.fr/gamme-renault/mini-sites-vehicules/nouvelle-clio-IV/), which Gilles says is a new model, and a very nice car. It will get somewhere around 40 mpg, which will be just fine with us, as diesel is about $7 per gallon (regular gasoline is about $8). (Post-trip edit: diesel was about $7.50 per gallon, and our Clio4 got just a touch under 50 miles per gallon for the time we were there. We <i>loved</i> that car: it was a little sporty, handled like a sports car, was quite peppy, and bright red!)

And, it has GPS! That alone is worth the price!

So, we have a house, a car and airline tickets. Now we just have to learn French. Actually, we'll be taking French lessons the first month we're there; all we want is to have reasonable restaurant/train station/hotel capabilities; we'll see...]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Paris on $1,000 per Day]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was talking to a fellow today and he said that he and his wife were planning a trip to Paris for 2014. He asked me, after hearing that we'd been there quite a few times, if $1,000 per day was enough for Paris. He'd heard that it "...was expensive" there. I laughed and told him I though they could have a great vacation on half that amount. Then I got to thinking about how much it could cost. Here's my estimate, based on how we spend money when we're in Paris:

[table th="0"]

Hotel[attr style="width:60px"], $300[attr style="width:60px"], Hotel des Deux Iles[attr style="width:100px"]

Breakfast,$32,At the hotel; expensive but worth it for us.

Lunch,$20-$25,"Sandwich and dessert from a boulangerie, or eat at a creperie."

Dinner,$100-$150,"Can get much higher! But this range will get you a very nice dinner in a nice restaurant, with a bottle of wine."

"Museums, visits, etc.",$25,"This amount will get two people into a museum. We <em>never </em>do more than one museum a day, so you might spend more. If we spent more that this, we'd be fried."

"Metro, busses, batobus, etc.", $25,"Might be more if you took taxis, but the metro is fast and the busses are fun."

"Bottle of wine for, er, refreshment and nourishment",$10-12,"Really, you can get very nice wines for this price. Want to splurge? Go all the way to $20. You won't believe the quality at that price compared to what you get for $20 in the U.S."

"<strong>Total</strong>",<strong>$512-569</strong>,"<strong>See, not bad!</strong>"

[/table]

I was a little off on my "half of a $1,000 per day" estimate, but not much, and I think with a slightly less expensive hotel, and staying at around $100 for dinner, you'd be there.

Now, you could spend a whole lot more (the<em> prix fixe</em> dinner at La Tour Argent is $260 for each person, not including wine, which probably starts in the $80/bottle range), and you could spend less. Hotel des Deux Iles is a small (17-room) hotel that we love dearly and has been our Paris "home"for almost 20 years; its location is unbeatable, on Ile St. Louis, but you can certainly find hotels for less. Careful, though; if you drop much below $200 per night, you are likely to be either a long way from the interesting parts of the city, or in a place that will disappoint. There are some excellent hotels in the $200-$250 range: Hotel des Deux Continents or Hotel de Seine, for example.

Our travel style tends toward the simple. Paris calls for walking, so we walk a lot. Our favorite thing is to walk along the Seine, especially at night. I think we do that every night we're there (helps that we stay on an island).

And of course, when you throw in airfare, the per day costs go right up. Summer 2014 airfares Seattle - Paris are in the $1,600 range, so add another $3,200 for airfare, spread out over ten days and now you're looking at $850-$900 per day, airfare included. All the more reason to stay longer: spreads out the airfare. In our case, we got tickets for $1,200 each (British Airways, before May 17) and we're staying 146 days, so our plane tickets add  only about $16 per day.

I think that a good minimum for us would be about $500 per day, which gets a nice hotel, meals in neighborhood restaurants (which will still be amazing), and no shopping sprees!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hard to believe, but after twenty years, Laurie retired last Monday. Tuesday she was pretty exhausted, both physically - from cleaning out her desk - and emotionally - from having everyone in the library, co-workers and patrons, come to say good-bye to her.</p>
<p>It will take her some getting used to it, certainly. We were talking about doing something and she said that we should wait until the weekend; I pointed out that, from now on, every day is a weekend day. "Oh…yeah…that's right…"</p>
<p>Tonight is the going-away party. Her colleagues decided to do it on a Friday off-site so they could have a real party, rather than treats in a library meeting room. Should be fun...no really, library parties can be fun. Honestly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're here, and so far, everything's gone just fine!<br /><br />The flights over passed the test for successful travel these days: they were uneventful. I know that's a rather low bar to success, but given the quality of air travel these days, it works. Both flights were on time, all our bags arrived with us; that's success!<br /><br />We did have one little last minute glitch: at noon on the day we left, we decided that maybe we should weigh the four suitcases, since there is a 23kg limit (51 pounds) for each. Surprise: three of the four were overweight by about ten pounds. We did some rapid re-packing and adjusting, and left a few things behind, and re-weighed. Looked good, so off we went. Official weights at the airport: 22.6kg, 22.4, 22.4, 22.2. Phew - a total of about 4 pounds on the light side. On the other hand, I don't think the woman checking us in even glanced at the weights, so maybe we would have gotten away without the re-packing panic.<br /><br />We stayed with Mary &amp; Gilles the first night and came to Montigny (pronounced "Monteenyee") the next day. The house we rented here is fine, but clearly showed signs that it's occupied only a few weeks a year. So the first day was clean and dust and clean some more and get the cobwebs down. Now, after a couple days, it's really starting to feel like home. The boulangerie a hundred yards down the street is - as judged by our friends here - an excellent one, and I am not going to argue that. I went this morning for croissants and didn't make a fool of myself. We'll be known there in a few days, for sure.<br /><br />Yesterday we got a phone. Mary had just bought a new phone and we got the old one. It's a decidedly non-smart phone, but perfect for our needs. We signed up for a pre-paid plan - through the post office - and get 3 hours of in-France phone calls for about $40. We can receive international calls, but not make them, which is just fine with us. <br /><br />And we'll have Internet in the house next week (or maybe the week after; after all, this is France). It'll be about $33 per month including a bunch of television channels. Until then, we get 15 channels, all in French, which does us little good! When Internet arrives, it'll be a whole lot easier to post and use email. <br /><br />And tomorrow we pick up our car, a Renault Clio4. It's a sporty little car and should get over 40 mpg on diesel. Diesel is cheaper that gasoline here, but I think it's still about $7 per gallon.<br /><br />France has had the coolest Spring ever recorded (and I'm not talking about "coolest" in the 'hip' sense, but temperature sense) and that's the way it's been since we arrived: cloudy and cool. We've gotten out for a few walks already, and ventured into the Fountainebleau forest this morning. Montigny borders the Fountainbleau forest, which was a preserve of French kings since Louis XIV in the 16th century and has been kept as a government-owned park. It has over 650 miles of marked paths and many more miles of informal ones. We're not going far into there without a map of the forest and our GPS! Otherwise, I can guarantee we'd get lost and probably never be seen again.<br /><br />So that's it for now. I think it is really sinking in that we're going to be here almost five more months. Guess I'd better call that woman we know about French lessons...<br /><br />A tout a l'heure!<br /><br />John<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Rue%20Georges%20Clemenceau,Chartrettes,France%4048.487054%2C2.702006&amp;z=10'>Rue Georges Clemenceau,Chartrettes,France</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laurie and I have always, on our travels, been drawn to water: rivers and canals in particular. So it's no surprise that today (May 19 - late post because of no Internet until today, May 29), the first sunny day we've had since we arrived, we would choose to walk along a canal that runs a mile or so south of here. The surprise was what we encountered there.</p>
<p>Canals criss-cross France; they are nearly all connected, so a canal boat can travel from the very north of France to the Mediterranean. Old canals are not wide, and the locks on them are built to a standard length and width specification which was once suitable for canal boats carrying goods. Today, though, for a canal boat to be profitable, it must be huge, and so they are limited to the larger rivers: near Chartrettes, where Mary and Gilles live, is a lock that is probably a quarter of a mile long and fifty yards wide. BIG boats use it, loaded heavily with rock and sand being taken to cement factories on the Seine north of Paris.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the old canals are left to pleasure boats: the canal-boat tours that are so popular, and private vessels, often converted from older, no-longer-profitable working boats. The canals are maintained beautifully and, for us, offer beautiful and peaceful walks. And for some reason, Laurie and I always enjoy watching boats go through the locks on canal or river.</p>
<p>This morning we walked along the Loing Canal, which parallels the Loing River (remember, we're living in Montigny-sur-Loing: "Montigny on the Loing". We reached a lock and while we were there, a car roared down the road to the lock, a man (wearing a tee-shirt, shorts and sandals, despite the cold breeze that blew) jumped out and set the lock to be ready for a boat coming upstream. Then he jumped in his car and roared off. We started to walk farther down the canal and saw that a boat was, indeed, coming upstream. So we walked back to the lock - l'ecluse - and waited. The boat eased into the lock as the lock-keeper returned. This was a tour-boat. We talked to the captain, who told us that he had 20 people on-board, that it was a bicycle tour, that everyone was off on their bikes and that he was going meet them in Nemours, 6 miles distant; he would arrive there in about 3 hours. Speed is not a factor on these canals.</p>
<p>The boat locked-through, and another boat arrived from upstream. This was a smaller, private vessel. It came into the locks, tied up and the owner stepped off and greeted us in poorly-pronounced French. Laurie commented on the sunshine, and the owner laughed and started speaking to us in English. Soon his wife joined us, finished with her duty of tying the front of the boat to the lock. They said that the lock-keeper had told them, at the last lock, that he would not be able to lock them through until after his lunch, which ended at 1 o'clock. So they were stuck for an hour.</p>
<p>We chatted with them for a while. They were from Ireland, and had been boating through France for four years; well, the parts of four years that the canals are open; it turns out that the canals close from October to March. Soon, Michael (we'd introduced ourselves by then; his wife was Rosemary) asked if we'd like to have a glass of wine with them. So onto the boat we went, and Michael opened a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>The conversation flowed and Rosemary asked if we could stay for lunch! Out came more wine, a beautiful salad she'd made, paté, sliced ham (a French staple), anchovies and cheese. We sat at a table on the back of the boat and had a wonderful meal with them. In fact, the lock-keeper returned and Michael asked him if he could delay locking them through for half an hour.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_4463.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_44631.jpg" alt="IMG 4463" width="600" height="400" border="0" /></p>
<p>I think we could have stayed all afternoon, but when the half-hour was up, the lock-keeper started making impatient noises and then another boat arrived. We took a hurried tour of their boat (the Mabel-Rose) and by the time we jumped off, the boat was half-way down in the lock; another minute and we would have needed a ladder to get off. If we'd known the next lock to be not too far away, we would have stayed on board and floated down the Loing Canal with Rosemary and Michael and gotten off there to walk back. But we didn't know how far we would have to walk (turned out to be about three miles), so we waved to Rosemary and Michaels as they disappeared around a bend in the canal.</p>
<p>We love serendipitous adventures like this. We have learned that being friendly and curious brings us experiences like this.We gave Rosemary and Michael our email addresses (the boat is fully connected to the 'net) and I suspect we'll be in touch, and we hope we can connect with them as we and they see France. They were delightful; it feels as if meeting them really started our French adventure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A word or two about Cleo, our Renault Clio4. This is a nice little car and, like its Citroen and Peugeot siblings, puts paid to the reputation that French cars deservedly earned in the United States in the 1960s. Who can forget the Renault Dauphine, or the Citroen DS-19 or any of a short line of Peugeots, cars of dubious reliability, design, comfort and appearance? Those days are gone.</p>
<p><br />This Clio4, a new Clio model, is a bit smaller than our Prius, to give you an idea of its size. Back seat legroom is not its strong point, but it has a much bigger trunk than the Prius. It's well-built, looks great, has a lot of pep, handles like a sports car and - here's the clincher - is getting 49 mpg average for the first couple hundred miles (or, as the French measure mileage: 4.8 litres/100 km). That is better mileage than we get with our Prius, and I can guarantee you that Cleo is a whole lot peppier and fun to drive.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_4485.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_44851.jpg" alt="IMG 4485" width="600" height="400" border="0" />Here's the Clio4/Prius summary: the Prius has more rear legroom. The Clio4 has more luggage space, more pep, and better mileage. I don't think you can touch a Prius in the United States for less than $22- or $23k; a baseline Clio4 (which is what we have, except we added GPS) is about $18,000. Makes me think Renault could succeed in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll tell you a bit about our "home" in France, Montigny sur Loing. We're about an hour south of Paris, by train or car (but who in their right mind would drive in Paris?). The town is about 2,800 people, though the daily population is some less than that, as many houses seem to be weekend homes and are closed up during the week.

Montigny has two restaurants, open only for lunch, two small general stores, and a boulangerie that our French friends pronounce to be far above average. My French has progressed to having an excellent grasp of all I need in the boulangerie, so my daily morning task is to walk down the street to the boulangerie and order a couple baguettes and a loaf of bread each morning.

The houses in Montigny range from "old French" to new and quite modern to very nice. Here are some pictures of houses in the town; see if you can guess which is <em>chez Zumsteg:</em>

</table>

This place is unbelievably quiet! At night there is simply no noise! (For the audiophiles among readers, our bedroom is 35db at night, with the window open.)

We've walked all over Montigny. It's just what we wanted: a small, old, quite pretty French village. Wouldn't mind a restaurant, though...]]></content:encoded>
